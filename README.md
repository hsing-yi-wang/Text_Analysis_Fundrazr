# Fundraising Prediction â€” Build Text Analysis Model with SVM, Publish Model with Flask & Heroku

#### I am passionate about using programming and data analysis to make a better life for others. To enhance my skills, I pick topics from Kaggle and also collect datas on my own to practice data science in Python & R.

*This repository one of my independent side projects. You are welcome to check out my Kaggle projects and course work in following repositories:*
