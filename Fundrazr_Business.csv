"1,000",Please Help Us Return Home to France to Mentor Entrepreneurs/Startups,Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,4,10%,"I am a native-born Californian with French family heritage and a
  French wife. My university background is in the Humanities and Social
  Sciences, with a year of graduate study at Oxford University,
  researching in the Bodleian Library. When I returned to northern
  California, I eventually landed an entry-level job at Intel
  Corporation, which proved to be the crucible for my entire career. I
  eventually rose to be a senior executive in international business
  development with Intel. I have continued in international business for
  all of my career, working for a number of tech startups and venture
  capital investment firms over the years. I have led two tech industry
  consortia to develop global industry standards. I have been the
  director of tech entrepreneurial incubator in Silicon Valley for the
  government of New Zealand and collaborated on mentoring promising
  entrepreneurs in locations here and around the world. I was an Adjunct
  Professor of Management at the University of British Columbia for four years. I want to return to France to give back my experience, skills, and
  technical knowledge to the country of my heritage. France's industrial
  economy is in the doldrums, but new policies are stimulating
  innovation, the key to economic growth and productivity, and
  technology industry leaders in France with strong technology industry
  backgrounds are looking to contribute to this new economy in France. I
  want to join them and give back. I am now semi-retired, but very eager to return permanently to France
  to donate my technology industry experience and knowledge to assist
  French entrepreneurs to transform France into an innovation-based
  economy. I am targeting specifically on working with three major new
  initiatives that could benefit from my background and achievements: The Camp in Aix-en-Provence, launched last
    year, Startup Garage, Paris , and 1kubator in Bourdeaux .  I am more
  than happy to share my achievements and references to validate my
  credentials and verify my ability to make a serious contribution. You
  can start here with my LinkedIn profile and references David Mayes on LinkedIn .  You may

180,Introducing Aquaponics into the Greek market,Euro,,of €2k goal,7,9%,"Hi, my name is Nicolas Bagkos and I come from Greece. In these difficult times with the economical crisis very few job
  opportunities are presented. The National Strategic Reference
  Framework (NSRF) for startups entrepreneurship, gives the opportunity
  to some of us take the risk and build an innovative company supported
  by the EU. My proposal to built a company that mainly is involved in novel
  patented constructions of aquariums, and especially aquaponic ones,
  has been accepted and preapproved. Aquaponics is a very new
  method/system for the Greek market and currently is limited to amateur
  pastime. Eventually this technology will enter the market, as
  Aquaponics gain ground worldwide. That's why I would like to do the
  customised introduction of Aquaponic systems in my country and create
  a non existent market. I have roughly a month to rent the appropriate place to house my
  startup company, before the final approval for the funding is to be
  given. I have found the place and I have to rent it as soon as
  possible. Unfortunately, I don't have the initial capital to pay in
  advance and this is the reason that I have started this campaign. With donations over 80€, I will post you one of these innovative
    and stylish aquariums. Donations over 30€, I will post you the hydroponic part of the
    system, customized to your needs. It includes the grow bed for the
    plants, LED lights for the plants and the fish, and the
    hydroelectric mechanism that feeds the lights. Less than 20€, I will post you promotional gifts, such as
    T-shirts, breloques and other cool stuff.",https://fundrazr.com/31DJF6

"6,743",Bookkeeping for Change - Phase 2,Canadian Dollar,,of $6k goal,46,112%,"August 2017 Dear Supporters For the past 2 years I have been working in Uganda with a local
  accounting firm. In my free time I meet with groups who want to learn
  how to improve their financial situation. One such group is the
  Osukuru United Women's Network in Tororo, eastern Uganda. This summer we ran a pilot program with half of the 40 savings groups
  in the Network to test if keeping a financial diary of their cash and
  credit transactions would lead to improved accountability and better
  financial decision making. The pilot's success was due, in a large part, to the commitment and
  passion of the Project Coordinator - Stephen Okolett, a retired
  teacher and husband of the Chair of the Osukuru Network. Stephen and I developed a program to train 16 unemployed high school
  graduates, who live in the same area as these women, in basic
  bookkeeping and financial management. Working in pairs these trainees
  met weekly with the savings groups to teach the women how to use the
  Cash Book and Credit Sales and Purchases Book. The results have been amazing. I visited the project this week to
  meet the interns and half of the 20 groups. The women described how
  bookkeeping has brought harmony and unity to their families and their
  communities. With transparency and accountability, husbands no longer
  accuse wives of mismanagement. Mothers no longer accuse their children
  of stealing. And loans between friends, credit sales and purchases no
  longer result in loss due to forgetfulness or arguments over amounts
  borrowed and paid. The simple act of record keeping on a daily basis engages the entire
  family. Many of the women are illiterate, except for numbers, so each
  night, the children, and sometimes the husbands, will help to update
  the ledgers. Using a simple coding system, the women can see how their businesses
  are doing. For some it was a revelation to find out they were actually
  losing money. Making the decision to find a better income generating
  activity immediately improved their financial circumstances. Keeping a financial diary has also managed to reduce spending.
  Because they have a code for 'unnecessary expenses' everyone is much
  more conscious and careful with how they spend their money - which
  means there's more money available for food, medicine and school fees.
  There was an interesting discussion over whether they should code
  'payments to husbands' as 'unnecessary'! The trainees were also eager to share how the program has affected
  their own spending habits. It's given them new insights into how they
  can control their purchase decisions and take responsibility to
  improve their financial circumstances. Our first Fundrazr campaign raised $4,000. This covered printing 2
  books for 650 women and the 3 month trainee program. We need to raise another $2,000 to print books for the rest of the
  Osukuru Network and run a 1 month training program.  With 3 months
  experience under their belts, the trainees can now complete the
  training in 4 weeks. I hope you will join in to support Phase 2 of Bookkeeping for Change.
  Once this is successfully completed, the next step will be to write a
  grant to scale up implementation. Thank you for your support! If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at rhoffman@ahuganda.com",https://fundrazr.com/Bookkeeping_for_Change
350,Le Pain D' Peace,,,,,,"Hello world! My name is Danny, I'm looking to get funding to start a
  clothing company called Le Pain D' Peace. I'm doing this with my wife Melina. The idea of the name came to me on my way to work, not liking what I
  was doing, feeling stuck in one place with no progression in sight,
  living from paycheck to paycheck. I had that impression of going
  nowhere, a feeling emptiness. With a backache in bonus from hurting
  myself at work. But I have a family to feed and the bills keeps on coming! The image that came to my head is the gingerbread man, as the tale
  goes, with my own interpretation, he did not accept his condition,
  coming out the oven stay there waiting to be eaten like the other
  biscuits he was cooked with. So he ran away, ran as fast as he could.
  Most of us knows the rest of the story, so no need for now to go with
  all the details. What hit me was that in French, my first language, gingerbread is
  called ""Pain d'épices"" - literally ""spicy bread"" .
  Pain means bread, and pain was what I was feeling at that time, both
  mentally and physically!  For ""d'épices"" it's pronounced -
  (d) A pēs - . So the word peace was what came to my mind and
    peace is exactly what I needed. The slogan that came to my mind was
    ""Life is Pain (D: will get to talk about that letter later on)
    and Peace! So that's pretty much all what the inspiration is! Then I have worked on a logo with a friend with I'm really proud of! The story continues...",https://fundrazr.com/11CxI6

"1,767",Mama Bear & Cub- Giving Mothers & Families options,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,37,35%,"Hello all thank you for taking the time to read this, and for
  considering donating. It means alot to us! I am opening a store on the West Side of Buffalo. We will sell a
  variety of products relating to pregnancy, birth, infants and
  toddlers, including new and gently used children's clothing - as well
  as offer classes and conversations in a community space in the
  building to expand new and experienced parents options when it comes
  to pregnancy, childbirth and early parenthood. I want to help other
  mamas and families in my community to be able to get stuff for their
  babies that gives them peace of mind. Nothing is more important to a
  Mama Bear than protecting her cub. I don’t want other mamas to have to
  go through the same exhausting research and process I did to find the
  things I needed to take care of my child and myself that would do no harm. This store is the logical conclusion to what has been one of the most
  rewarding but also one of the most challenging parts of my life. It’s
  a deeply personal project so I want to share with you about it. A little about me: I am a Proud African American Women, mother, wife,
  doula, and aspiring Midwife and not in that order. When I met my
  husband Nate and got pregnant with our daughter, Nayeli, life changed.
  It had to. I had to start caring about what I put in my body. I had to
  care about what I exposed myself and her to. You can ask Nate - it was
  the hardest change i ever had to do. Because for my whole life I
  didn't care about the food I ate or the products I put in my body or
  on my skin. I did not give it a second thought. Why should I right? I cry a little as I write this because it was not until I looked
  outside my own scope that I realized I had been poisoning myself with
  my daily choices and I had no idea. I was constantly shocked at the ways that my choices about everything
  from food to what kind of container I drank water from everyday could
  affect mine and more importantly my future child’s health. I was never
  taught about the real harm of pesticides, BPA’s or GMO’s. To me
  organic or more expensive options were just another way to charge more
  money. As far as birth was concerned I thought you go to the hospital
  and lay on your back and boom a baby comes out and “if all else fails”
  you have a C-section. You are told to listen to the experts if you
  want to be a good mom. “It's what is best for the baby.” And you
  listen - because all you want for this unborn child is to be good to them. Though after hearing, seeing and reading enough, I understood a lot
  more and with new knowledge comes, dare I say, great responsibility.
  The seed of doubt was planted. If they lied to me about Columbus and
  food, what else have they lied to me about? BIRTH! So I started
  learning as much as I could about all of it and I continue to learn
  about my different options. I had the great fortune to meet my Midwife on the day I found out I
  was pregnant, a woman who has dedicated her life to midwifery. I would
  go on to meet my close friend who has been a mentor as I have learned
  more and more about birth. The story of birth I was taught by these
  women was a vastly different from the one I’d been taught for all my
  life. These women, along with my experiences, have inspired me to
  become a doula for others and to tell my story. So, then this amazing child Nayeli was born and so did the
  overwhelming task of keeping her safe. Real tears I cried after
  looking into many of the standard baby products that existed. We
  shouldn't have to worry about the baby mattress we put our child down
  on or the clothing we put on their skin, or what we bathe them in or
  when they’re ready to eat, the food we put in their little bellies.
  How can these companies not care about their harmful products that
  they label as safe with no conscious? It is wrong and there is nothing
  more to it. I want to empower women and families with more options and
  opportunities to provide a healthy life for their children. I want to
  give them the peace of mind that before they buy something, they can
  touch, feel and see for themselves that they made the most conscious
  choice they could. I am very discouraged by the statistics of prenatal care, childbirth
  and infant health in our country generally and particularly for women
  of color. I know that these options are particularly less available
  for woman of color. I will offer free classes in the community open to
  everyone to encourage dialogue, knowledge, and broaden options around
  pregnancy, childbirth and early parenting. We need to work together to
  make better choices because our next generation deserves that! To be honest, I was angry. I am still angry that these choices for us
  and our children are not easier. I am angry as everyone should be. I
  am taking that anger and I am creating a place for mamas (and papas
  and grandmas and grandpas, who ever make the choice to come thru those
  doors are welcome) - to buy stuff they can trust and to learn together. Nate and I have been saving money for years to make this happen. Some
  of the money is needed to finish the build out of the store, pay
  insurance and help to buy the point of sales system. The money will
  also support classes I am committed to keeping free and to help set up
  a diaper scholarship so that families in need never go without the
  essentials . I will use some of the money for classes and
  certifications to better my knowledge. $5,000 dollars would allow me
  to do that. I am extremely grateful for any contribution and we are not a exactly
  a silicon valley start up so I can offer no percentage return on your
  investment but I as we proceed, I will honor your contribution by
  t-shirts, Onesies, sticker or buttons and my everlasting gratitude. I

  entrepreneurs. We see the education and commerce as paths to
  prosperity. Like many of you, I am amazed at the level of small scale
  entrepreneuriasm in South America and Africa, two areas of the world
  where Opportunity InternationaI concentrates their efforts. Business
  credit in these third world countries is often akin to ""loan
  sharking"" - micro finance allows us to give the impoverished a
  fair shake and a hand up. Last year's ride was a great experience with awesome support and
  exceptional team members. The biggest obstacle was a psychological
  one...wearing a jersey with one of our worthy competitors name on it!
  I (Chris) got over it and made sure it didn't happen again this year
  :). We are now pulling out the stops and pounding out the miles.
  Arleen will be tackling the 85 km route, while I will
  be attempting to play with the big boys in the 145 km ride...slowly, I am sure. So how did we make out last year? Between the generous donations from
  many supporters, our personal commitment and a $ for $ matching
  program, the grand total pegged in at $14700. This year, we are going
  for the high bar, with nervous treptitation, we have set our ""all
  in"" fund raising goal at $25,000.00. To help get us there, we
  have lined up a $ for $ matching program through the Raymond James
  Canada Foundation (RJCF), Psalm115:1 account. That's right, for every
  $ you donate, RJCF will be stepping up with a matching $, up to an
  aggregate limit of $25000. A value proposition, I hope you can't refuse. Interested? What follows are some stories of the people you will be

"4,130",Jeff's Ride to reduce Poverty with Microfinance,Canadian Dollar,,of $3k goal,53,138%,"Hi Friends, many of you will know that I rode in this race last year.
   I'm looking forward to 140km of amazing Victoria roads, hills and
  trails, but most importantly in reestablishing the friendships I
  developed with the group that I rode with last year. There were 10 of
  us that rode together last year, all of us competitive, all pushing
  each other, but none so much as to leave a comrade behind. While the training was gruelling, the race tested our endurance and
  mental toughness, the defining point for me was going down a hill at
  km 75.  Riding in a group, is tricky.  Going 60+km downhill in the
  group is not for the faint of heart.  When a father and his daughter
  crashed just in front of us, the rest of the riders scattered to avoid
  more pile ups, but all 10 of us stopped immediately, got off our
  bikes, and attended to the injured. In the moment, it didn't seem special at all, just human.  But it was
  after the 45 minutes had passed, when the Father/Daughter were loaded
  into the Ambulance, (broken bones, punctured lung and concussed) and
  we hopped back on our bikes and rejoined the race that it began to
  sink in.  Altruism is rare in our society of Rush, Rush, Rush.  But
  our team is made up of some amazing people and we believe in helping others. Opportunity International is an amazing organization that does this
  on a daily basis.  They target countries where poverty is rampant but
  work ethic remains strong.  OI, finds people that want to open or
  expand their current business.  OI (we) help them to ensure that their
  business idea is sound, we train them on how to succeed, we provide
  assistance with understanding the business world, then we provide them
  with a loan get going. We follow up to ensure their success, the
  business person repays the loan, and then we use this money again to
  perpetuate the cycle so that another person now has a continued source
  of income.  This organization is not about hand-outs .
   It's about giving a hand-up !  We help people who
  want to help themselves and one  family at a time, we are breaking the
  cycle of poverty. My request of you...  Please support me in this fundraising effort.
   I need your help to achieve this success.  Please click on the link
  to make your donation now.  I'm excited to say that everydonation that
  is made on or before June 30 will be matched by a private donor.
   While my goal for this year is $3000, If I can reach this by June 30,
  then together, we will have effectively raised $6000.  At an average
  of $150/loan, that means that our fundraising alone could change the
  lives of 40 families. Also, I will add that if you like the idea that I've presented, we
  still have the ability to add more members to our team.  Please send
  me a note and I'll connect you to the right people.  If you live in
  Comox Valley and want to join me for a training ride anytime, I'd love
  the company.  5k, 20k, 50k or more, whatever speed you want to go,
  let's ride together. I thank you for considering this organization and hope that you'll be
  part of our victory. Sincerely, Jeff ps, I've attached a story of one of our loan recipients below.  It

  begin adding perler art and custom paintings to our shop, as long as

  holds very true in this industry. We are looking for donations that
  will go towards booking spots at conventions, paying for travel, and
  supplies, to help start our company in a postive light! Every dollar
  helps, and goes directly to the business. And what cons are we looking to become a vendor at? So far we have three in mind; One is located in Michigan, and the
  other two are in our home state of Ohio. Each vary in price for
  booking a table, but average around 100 dollars, excluding travel expenses. In closing, any donations are taken with extreme gratitude. If we reach $500, I will be holding a raffle for everyone who donated

417,Support Burnout King's development - Early Access!,Australian Dollar,,of $10k goal,66,4%,"Burnout King , brought to you by two mobile gaming
  enthusiast and supported by one of the top burnout teams in Australia
  aims to bring the intense petrol fuelled world of burnouts to your
  mobile devices. Progress so far: So far we have produce a lite proof of concept that aimed to prove a
  few keys components: First off that we can produce a burnout game that performs
    smoothly on a mobile device whilst holding true to the core burnout mechanics That we can refine the control inputs and create a control scheme
    for burnout gameplay that is both fun and also challenging aligned
    to the challenges of actually controlling a burnout in real life That we can build an interactive map to allow the player a
    ‘sandbox’ environment to explore and discover events / interact with
    the game That this game will be challenging, rewarding and fun! Now that we have proved the 4 key factors listed above it is
      time to move into developing the full-blown first version of
      Burnout King. Our Goal: Our goal is to create the best mobile burnout game possible. To do
  this we need your support to bring Burnout King to your phone/tablet
  and to make sure that it is the best possible game that we could develop. The key features that we need to build to make it an awesome game: Burnout Gameplay! This may sound like a no-brainer
    however it isn’t as easy as it sounds! As there are currently no
    pure burnout games on the market we are developing the gameplay to
    mimic the real world experience of doing a burnout. Supported and
    play-tested by our friends at H8tred racing we are tweaking our game
    engine to bring you the balance between realism and fun! Customisable cars: The world of competition
    burnouts is based around a culture of uniqueness and auto
    modification. We need to carry that through into this app and ensure
    that the customization abilities for the cars that you choose to
    build are in-depth, meaningful and of course as crazy as they are in
    real life. Tweaking, tweaking and more tweaking: Once you
    have customised your car you can be the mechanic. Just like in the
    world of competition burnouts your car is your temple and you can
    tune it exactly how you would like. We want to bring this experience
    through into the game and allow you to specifically tune your
    vehicle of choice for each event. A clean UI. It sounds simple however designing and
    building a clean, usable and intuitive user interface is an art in itself. Game modes – whether you are starting off in your
    burnout career or taking one of the bespoke – real world legends
    cars for a spin we need to build in all the fun and sometimes
    painstaking parts of the burnout lifestyle into Burnout King. Timeframes: We have developed an initial gameplay demo that turned out pretty cool! We are aiming to be ready for launch onto the Apple app store and
    Google Play store before Christmas We will provide updates as we go with early access provided to
    selected community members. Early Access: We are opening up donations for early access to the current
    Burnout King development version. Please note this is a super early development version and is very
    basic - but still extremely fun! Donators can chose PC or Android and will receive their respective
    versions shortly after 30/9. iOS users will need to purchase the PC version and play within a
    web browser on a pc / surface for now - Burnout King will definitely
    come out on iOS(Apple) devices before Christmas.",https://fundrazr.com/112Dp0

  poorest country in Latin America and the second poorest in the Western
  Hemisphere after Haiti. Close to 50% of the 6.5 million people are
  living below the poverty line (32% with less than $2 per day). The
  unemployment rate is 7% and underemployment is over 46% which means
  that most Nicaraguans do not have a source of income to meet the most
  basic needs of their families. Nicaragua needs an influx of capital to
  stimulate the development of the private sector in the poorest and
  marginalized areas of the country in order to break the cycle of poverty. OPPORTUNITY INTERNATIONAL Opportunity International provides access to financial solutions
  empowering people living in poverty to transform their lives, their
  childrens futures, and their communities. $150 dollars funds one loan,
  is repaid and re-loand every 3 months and helps mothers provide more
  meals, regular schooling, and basic santization for their kids.
  Families, communities, and regions are developing out of poverty
  because of this powerful tool that is recycled and multiplies. Read
  more WOMEN represent an estimated 70% of those living on less than
  $2/day. Cultural and legal inequalities in developing countries create
  obstacles that prevent women from starting and financing new
  businesses.This leaves them more vulnerable to poverty, forced labour
  and violence. Yet, women consistently show inspiring resilience and
  determination to find ways to break free from poverty. Many studies,
  and our own experiences, confirm that women with access to financial
  services can dramatically improve the quality of life for their
  families. In families where women have an income, they have a voice in
  financial decisions, resulting in better nutrition, health and
  education for children. When family needs are met, women are more
  likely to invest in their community. When women have the skills to
  participate in public life, government corruption declines. The gains
  that women achieve by accessing microfinance services are almost 3
  times more likely to be reinvested in their children, providing a
  powerful generational multiplier that accelerates economic growth. By Supporting this ride you will be supporting people to start, run

  teens, bestowing hours on end to the benefactor of children’s academic
  and social growth. But, due to drastic changes in the educational
  system that I felt were not conducive to children or teachers, I
  decided it was time to do something for myself and my daughter and to
  transfer from feeding minds to feeding bellies… J So, in order to hone in on the fact that I had dedicated many years
  to education, I named my food truck business, “The School of Bacon.” I love to cook, I love bacon and I love making others happy. I have
  also worked in the service industry since I was a young teen,
  waitressing, catering, and eventually graduating to bartending. As a

   Most of us know that giving money and supplies without any support or

  loans don't just give people the money they need to get on their feet
  again, they provide hope and empowerment when these loans are coupled
  with support, education and a real plan for the long-term success of
  each entrepreneur. Please consider donating to this cause. If you have any questions

"1,885",9Round Appleton Kickboxing #ibacked9rndappleton,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,18,19%,"Hi, I'm Bree, a Menasha native, and I'm bringing 9Round Kickboxing to
  Appleton, WI and I need your support. 9Round offers a kickboxing
  themed fitness program that incorporates a functional, interval,
  cardiovascular, and circuit training regimens. Whether you want to get
  in shape, lose weight, build endurance, or get stronger, this, fast,
  fun, full body workout will keep you motivated and on track to reach
  your fitness goals! I can't do this on my own and I need your help with funding to
  purchase equipment for the gym. I've personally done many different cardio kickboxing high intensity
  interval classes in the past...at the YMCA...at big box gyms...in my
  living room...but something was always missing. That something was the
  resistance that comes with hitting a real punching bag. At 9Round, I
  first experienced and felt energized from that resistance and
  immediately became a member. As I attended my gym more and more, I fell in love and soon learned
  that they franchise. At that point, I knew that I had to own a gym of
  my own, and set out on that journey. I wrote a business plan including
  profit and loss forecasts, demographic research, and competitive
  analysis and sat down with 9Round corporate to discuss how we could
  bring this impactful workout to the area where I was born and raised,
  Appleton, WI. WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT? 9Round is a specialized fitness center dedicated to serving clients
  who want a unique, fun, and proven workout that guarantees results.
  The programs consist of a proprietary system of 9 challenging workout
  stations developed by a professional fighter, and provides a full-body
  workout in just 30 minutes. 9Round Website At 9Round, our personal trainers take your workout to the next level.
  It is our job to make you fall in love with the workout, not just the
  first or second time, but every time, and we intend to do just that.
  We will modify the workout to ensure that you are getting the tailored
  workout that you deserve. You may start out only doing 1 or 2
  stations, but the personal trainers are there to make sure that you
  are progressing through the workouts and getting better each and every
  time that you come into the gym. And lets not forget, this is fun! At 9Round there are no class times, that means no more rushing to the
  gym to get a spot in class or missing a class because your boss asked
  you to work late. Work out on your time, every time. Because you
  deserve to workout when you want. At 9Round, everyone get's a boxing name when they sign up for a
  membership. Mine is Bumblebree...float like a butterfly, sting like a
  bee...what will yours be? PROJECT GOALS This fitness club will be made available in Fall 2015. Get notified of when we open, click here! The money raised from this campaign will be used to purchase
  equipment for the facility and complete the build out. The total
  needed is about $20,000, I will kick-in $10,000 out of pocket, but I
  need a jump start to raise the rest of the money. The equipment
  includes kettle bells, free weights, punching bags, benches, jump
  ropes, TRX bands, etc. COMMUNITY This health club will be more than a source of income and financial
  stability, it will be a part of the community where we continually
  give back, from forming teams and fundraising for the Sole Burner and
  Diabetes Walk, to hosting a ""kicks for cancer"" campaign to
  support Breast Cancer awareness. Generosity matters, not just on a
  personal level, but on a corporate level, and if you know me, you know
  that I am passionate about changing lives and changing the world for
  the better. LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION. Why the Fox Cities? I was born and raised in Menasha, a city within
  the Fox Cities. I've been out and about exploring the states for the
  past 7 years, so this will be my homecoming. These kickboxing gyms
  have been successful in southern Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Oak Creek,
  Madison) and it's time that we bring this awesome workout to the great
  people of the Fox Cities. For those of you that don't know, the Fox Cities are a group of
  cities in Northeastern Wisconsin that have grown along the Fox River
  as it flows from Lake Winnebago north to Green Bay. A center of
  papermaking and printing, the area is one of the 50 top manufacturing
  regions in the nation (wikipedia). Fun fact #1: The Fox River Mall located in Appleton is the largest
  mall in the state of Wisconsin (wikipedia). Fun fact #2: Harry Houdini claimed Appleton as his hometown and there
  is a museum in town where you can experience some of Houdini's tricks
  of the trade through hands-on activities. Fun fact #3: When the broadway shows Lion King and Wicked came to
  Wisconsin, they premiered at the Performing Arts Center (PAC) in
  downtown Appleton. Not Milwaukee. Not Madison. APPLETON! Fun fact #4: The Hearthstone Historic House was the first private
  home in the world to have lights powered by a central hydroelectric
  station. The Hearthstone is now a museum, open to visitors for guided
  tours on the history of hydroelectric power in the area as well as the
  building's Victorian art and 19th-century architecture. (A few things to add to your list of ""things to do"" when
  you come to town for the pre-launch party.) As far as competition goes, the Fox Cities has many competitors:
  bootcamps, kickboxing classes, strength training classes, big box
  gyms. But none can quite compare to all that 9Round has to offer:
  personal trainer, no class times, full-body workout in 30 minutes,
  competitive pricing. Need I say more? BACKGROUND The first 9Round was opened in 2008 by professional kickboxer Shannon
  Hudson, and franchising was offered 1 year later in 2009. Currently,
  there are 220 gyms across 39 states and 4 countries. To support the
  success of this growing company, 9Round has been named to multiple
  prestigious lists including Forbes Magazine's annual list of America's
  Most Promising Companies, Entrepreneur Magazines Top 500 Franchises,
  and was recently featured on the cover of Franchising USA magazine. 9Round on Cover of Franchise USA Magazine About me... I studied biomedical engineering at Marquette University.
  A love for math and science made engineering an obvious choice, and a
  fascination of the human body drew me to biomedical. I graduated in
  2010 with the dream of designing medical devices to transform people's
  lives through treatment of various health diseases and I set off
  across the country (WI->CA) to pursue my dream (sorry mom). After
  enduring 7 years of working in the medical device industry, sitting
  for hours in a bland cubicle, staring at a computer screen, and
  feeling restless and incomplete, I've decided its time to throw off
  the shackles of my corporate cubicle and make a career change. Though I excel at math and science, my skill and passion are in
  learning, teaching, and working hard towards a common goal with other
  passionate people. This 9Round opportunity gives me the chance to use
  my skills every day. I get to learn marketing, advertising, growing a
  business, and human resources. And I get to teach, train, and work
  towards a common health goal with my customers daily on a personal
  level. This health club gives me the opportunity to make a difference
  in the community that I grew up in, and while it's on a much smaller
  scale than the impact of commercializing a new medical device, it pays
  the same dividends in allowing me to change people's lives. INCENTIVES There are a variety of incentives to choose from. Everyone that
  donates will be invited to the exclusive pre-launch party to be held
  on site at the 9Round location to gain an exclusive preview of the
  space AND will be memorialized for their support on the supporter
  ""Wall of Fame."" Other incentives include: Wide range of membership deals Apparel and other branded merchandise Fund a station! Donate to fund a station, either entirely or with
    partners. The station will feature a plaque memorializing the donors. Get the word out to other fitness and health enthusiasts. Really, I need help. I would like your support today!",https://fundrazr.com/5120Y8
340,Please help Brian to save his business.,U.S. Dollar,,of $3k goal,7,11%,"My name is Brian Sweeney and I am a small business owner that lives
  Maine. I have worked as a Graphic Designer at a sign shop for the past
  4 years. I had always wanted to own my own business, and in 2014, I had the
  opportunity to purchase the business I was working for. It took
  everything I had to purchase it, but since it was an established
  business, I reasoned that it shouldn’t require a large cash reserve. Everything was going great until I was suddenly forced to move the
  business because of back rent that previous owner was supposed to have
  paid out of the proceeds of the sale, but didn’t. At that time I was
  traveling 100 miles a day back and forth to work, so I decided to
  relocate the business close to home to save on travel cost. Having to move quickly and on a tight budget meant my choices were
  limited. And almost immediately after the move I started having issues
  with my new location and landlord. My shop flooded several times, even
  though I had been told specifically by my new landlord that there had
  never been any water problems. I had problems with power being shut
  off several times because the power was included in the rent and even
  though I paid my portion of the bill to the landlord, the bill didn’t
  get paid on time. The landlord had promised to separate the meters,
  but never followed through. When I looked at the property, in the middle of the warm season, I
  was told that a new furnace would be installed before cold weather.
  But I wasn't provided with a heat source until December (it gets
  really cold in Maine during the Winter). In January the building was hit by a snowplow, leaving a large hole
  in the wall open to the outside, making it impossible to heat. The
  landlord has not fixed any problems with the building. All of these things have made it impossible for me to work reliably,
  which has both meant that I’ve lost some customers and that I’ve had
  to scramble just to stay alive. Unfortunately, moving is an expensive proposition, and well beyond my
  means after all these other problems.  I am trying to raise $3,000 in
  order to relocate my business and get back to work. Thank you for your time reading this and supporting my cause.",https://fundrazr.com/512wf5

  relaxed atmosphere, one where you can feel as comfortable at home as
  you do at the bar. A place where you can enjoy a quiet glass of wine
  with a book, or dance the night away to your favorite band. We are reaching out to friends, family and those we have met from
  across the bar, at a concert, or anywhere along the path this crazy
  service industry has taken us! We are taking on this project without
  funding or investors. It seems you can wait on the promise of funding
  but it never seems to show up or you wait years and the opportunity is
  over, so we have decided to take the bull by the horns and make this
  dream a reality! Every dime we have has been and continues to be put
  into this dream and along the journey we have realized that the
  support of friends and family is what keeps us strong and moving
  forward at full speed. We aim to keep the community involved, both near and far and your
  support is valued and necessary. A fundraiser was planned for the end
  of august but due to setbacks in construction and licensing this wont
  be possible. We have put together a list of the cost of items and what
  we're doing so you can see where the funding is needed and what
  donations will be used for. We are completing renovations on our own
  and Google can only offer so much expertise so we can always use
  support from those skilled/certified in carpentry or electrical. We are the first to know that our lives are at different stages and
  we all have many obligations and so this is our way of informing you
  about this exciting journey, to keep you updated and offer an
  opportunity to you to help out in any way you are able to, a phone
  call, an email or a simple “good luck” means a lot to us and keeps us
  pushing forward! Please also see this as a personal invitation to stop by, say hello,
  and take in some entertainment! To those of you not on the east coast,
  you need to get out here and experience the relaxed atmosphere, and

  we've won a competition through the Arkwright Scholarships Trust to represent the UK
  at an international science exposition (ExpoCiencias) in Mexico. We
  have to design and display a technical project that is interactive for
  the attendees. Our project is a robot that will roam an area and clear it of debris.
  We give a lot more information about how it could be used and the
  design process on our site here , if you're interested. Costs A detailed breakdown of our costs can also be found on our site, on
  the fundraising post, but essentially
  we need to pay for flights, materials/components for the robot, an
  accommodation fee, display material (canvas posters etc.), and any
  travel or other expenses that may be incurred. Please donate to help
  us get to Mexico; any money we raise will go towards this trip, and if
  we get more than we need we will simply make the robot even cooler! Thanks! We're incredibly grateful for any support you can give us, however
  small! Depending on what the response is like, we may feature your
  name/picture on our display if you donate a certain amount, as a
  thanks for your contribution.",https://fundrazr.com/511NH8
"5,740",Let's Make Wine with Carter Lamour,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,62,29%,"There's an old adage about roads travelled and the choices we must
  make between them that has all of the great hallmarks of wisdom
  imparted: brevity, broad imagery, and a voice certain of its value. But life isn't as orderly as words written on a page, and is
  infinitely more complicated than any spoken analogy or metaphor can
  communicate.  It's a place where difficult roads are often times
  chosen for you, and real answers are found in the spaces between the
  lines, rather than written neatly on top of them. A few weeks prior to the 2013 Harvest, upcoming Washington winemaker
  (and my younger brother) Dain Carter, was paralyzed in an accident on
  his birthday. What began as a day celebrating his life and recent
  career accomplishments, ended as a night filled with fear, anxiety,
  and uncertainty. The only thing that WAS certain? That I would do anything to help
  him. It turned out that so many of YOU would as well, and
  contributions through our combined fundraising efforts in the first 16
  months post-injury have helped support all of the things needed as one
  literally starts their life over. The launching of our eponymous new wine label, Carter Lamour, hasn't
  merely been years in the making. It's been two lifetimes spent on a
  road that began in the wheat fields of Kansas, bent through the
  vineyards of eastern Washington and finally led to a place where the
  ocean meets the mountains...the gates of the Emerald City. A place
  where even a dream interrupted can still come true. Your contribution towards the fundraising goal will help
    Carter Lamour through the infancy stage of growth, and will provide
    immediate infrastructure essentials such as: high-quality used
    barrels for wine storage, barrel racks, fermentation vessels,
    harvest supplies, and fruit .  Our supporters will be the
  first to receive special offers and discounts on future releases, get
  sneak peak video, picture and story updates on what starting a winery
  looks and feels like, plus all of the damn Inspiration you can stand
  that will come from following our story. Reflecting on the transition from an unexpected career calling
  (caregiving) back to my true passion (winemaking) has illuminated a
  few truths in my life: a commitment to always give with my whole
  heart, a resolute patience in all things...and the certainty that I've
  never felt alone in the process. So please, be a part of Carter Lamour and together, Let's Make Wine!",https://fundrazr.com/d10600

    $100 dollars, 60 giving $50, 120 giving $30. There is a segment for
    each of you, Please consider supporting me and giving people an opportunity! Once a year I ask my personal community to consider supporting an
  effort like this. My story as many of you know starts with a personal
  life trauma and a passion for helping people. After exploring all of
  the global issues like clean water, human trafficking, infant
  mortality, equality, I felt pretty overwhelmed. The a Mentor of mine
  introduced me to Microfinance through Opportunity International. I
  believe business is an underutilized vehicle for dignity, purpose,
  community and perhaps most of all meaning creation. I love creating,
  and each business is a form of creation. The fact that -Each of my donated dollars turned into $1.05 by the end of a year -That small businesses were being created, which produced profit, in
  turn allowing parents to porudly and with dignity take care of their
  families needs (that means more than 1 meal a day for their kids, a
  toilet in their home, education for the kids, not being pressured to
  sell kids into trafficking or servitude) -That women are the majority of the loan holders -That the repayment rate is 98% in 3 months, and then the dollars are reloand There were so many qulaitative and quantitative elements. It became a
  no brainer for me to donate. 7 Years later I was hired on staff and I
  know have the honor of sharing this story, and inviting people to
  create more meaning in life by supporting amazing people in developing
  countries that never typically have an opportunity. It is like that kid in the class who has so much potential, and yet
  you see them not being able to get out of the weeds. Everyone
  worldwide should ahve the opportunity for a life free from Poverty
  with Dignity and Purpose. The image below is me an Issabelle. She is the third client I met. I

  delicious farm to table eats will fit right in. We have a great
  following but need it to grow so our business can flourish. Our
  business is a little different because we are constantly trying to
  give back as much as we can to our wonderful supporters. Along with
  our food and drinks we also welcome aspiring artists, from music to
  painters, and poets to come in and display their talent at no cost. We
  believe that their talent deserves recognition. With our move to the
  new location coming up quick, we have to get a few more things for the
  business to ensure a successful opening. With the money we raise we
  will obtain signage, equipment, and our marketing campaign. We believe

    like Yesenia. Yesenia del Socorro Rostran, Managua, Nicaragua, 32 years old. Daily routine: She gets up at 3:40 am, she starts the day by cleaning
  the corn for the tortillas, then her husband and 13 year old son take
  the corn to be grained . She starts making tortillas at 4:30 am.

  while doing house work. At 4 pm she goes to the market to replenish
  supplies for the businesses. Garlic business: She buys boxes of garlic, which she then packages
  them by weaving banana leaf through the middle. She sells packages of

  store, to buy garlic in bulk, to buy bigger pigs to sell the meat. NEED IN NICARAGUA: MICROFINANCE SERVICES Nicaragua is the
  poorest country in Latin America and the second poorest in the Western
  Hemisphere after Haiti. Close to 50% of the 6.5 million people are
  living below the poverty line (32% with less than $2 per day). The
  unemployment rate is 7% and underemployment is over 46% which means
  that most Nicaraguans do not have a source of income to meet the most
  basic needs of their families. Nicaragua needs an influx of capital to
  stimulate the development of the private sector in the poorest and
  marginalized areas of the country in order to break the cycle of poverty. OPPORTUNITY INTERNATIONAL Opportunity International provides access to financial solutions
  empowering people living in poverty to transform their lives, their
  childrens futures, and their communities. $150 dollars funds one loan,
  is repaid and re-loand every 3 months and helps mothers provide more
  meals, regular schooling, and basic santization for their kids.
  Families, communities, and regions are developing out of poverty
  because of this powerful tool that is recycled and multiplies. Read
  more WOMEN represent an estimated 70% of those living on less than
  $2/day. Cultural and legal inequalities in developing countries create
  obstacles that prevent women from starting and financing new
  businesses.This leaves them more vulnerable to poverty, forced labour
  and violence. Yet, women consistently show inspiring resilience and
  determination to find ways to break free from poverty. Many studies,
  and our own experiences, confirm that women with access to financial
  services can dramatically improve the quality of life for their
  families. In families where women have an income, they have a voice in
  financial decisions, resulting in better nutrition, health and
  education for children. When family needs are met, women are more
  likely to invest in their community. When women have the skills to
  participate in public life, government corruption declines. The gains
  that women achieve by accessing microfinance services are almost 3
  times more likely to be reinvested in their children, providing a
  powerful generational multiplier that accelerates economic growth. By Supporting this ride you will be supporting people to start, run
  and grow small business that will creates jobs for family and
  communities memebers so that our neighbors in the developing world can

580,Help Provide Immigrants Access to Legal Services,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,11,6%,"MISSION Our mission is to improve the lives of immigrants by providing high
  quality accessible legal services tailored to the immigrant experience. VISION We envision a law firm that values its clients, community and
  employees as much as it values its profits. We strive to assist our
  clients not only with their immigration matters but in accessing all
  the rights and benefits that they are entitled to as new Americans. Who We Are? Lacroix Ramos is comprised of two young attorneys with a passion for
  public service, social justice and immigrant rights. Stephanie Lynn
  Ramos, Esq and Miriam D. Lacroix, Esq. formed this practice to provide
  services to immigrants who need and deserve compentent legal repesentation. Initially, the two attorneys wanted to begin a non-profit law firm to
  provide these services. However, as they further researched the legal
  and funding requirements they realized that forming a non-profit
  organization was not viable because funding for ongoin immigrant legal
  assistance is extremely limited and the structure of non-profit
  organizations is too cumbersome. The funding that is availble would
  limit the types of clients and cases to which the firm could provide
  services. Additionally, that funding is highly competative and already
  being utilized by very amazing organization doing great work for the
  immigrant community. Stephanie & Miriam realized that in order to expand the amount of
  competent accessible legal services to immigrants they would have to
  start a for-profit law firm. And so, Lacroix Ramos, Attorneys at Law,
  LLP was created. The firm seeks to be a for-profit with a non-profit
  spirit of community, justice, advocacy and accessbility. Why donate? General Statistics: One of the most important variables affecting a
      successful outcome in an immigration case is having representation. 27 percent of non-detained immigrants do
        not have counsel by the time their cases are completed 74 percent of non-detained immigrants with
      representation have successful outcomes whereas only 13
        percent of non-detained immigrants without
      representation have successful outcomes People facing deportation in New York Immigration Courts with a
      lawyer are 500 percent more likely to win their
      cases as those without representation This is a one time ask . We are only asking for funds
  to get up and running. We have worked to build a strong plan of action
  to remain sustainable while still providing accessible service to
  immigrants of varying economic ability. Immigrants in our current service area need legal represenatatives
  that are fair, compassionate and competent. Lacroix Ramos is striving
  to be those representatives. We are building partnerships with local
  non-profit organizations to provide pro bono and low bono services
  including cosultations, supervision for accredited representatives and
  community education events. Your donation will help Lacroix Ramos build a strong foundation upon
  which to launch our practice and help as many people as possible. What are we going to use the funds for? Priority Funding Needs - Goal $10,000 Office Equipment & Supplies → $3,000 printer, scanner, shredder, file cabinets, safe Technology and Communication Services → $2000 translation and interpretation services; case management
        software; email and cloud storage; website development Malpractice Insurance → $2,000 will cover one year Laptop Computers → $1,000 (so attorneys can be mobile) Legal Reference Library → $2,000 (so attorneys can stay up to date!) Kurzbans & other Immigration reference materials & subscriptions Additional funds over $10,000 will be used to pay rent for the office
  and allow us to have a day office in remote locations to expand our
  service areas. What else? We'll have more PERKS to come! Don't worry! If you donate before the
  new perks are up, we'll still provide you (or the third party
  non-profit) the appropriate perk for your donation level unless you

260,Help young people living in state care - Argentina,Pound Sterling,,of £1k goal,15,26%,"Hola! I'm completing the peninsular triathlon on the 11th October and
  my brother, Ben, is completing the Beachy Head marathon on Saturday
  24th October. We are doing it to fundraise for Doncel, an Argentinian NGO I
  was fortunate enough to be involved with during my time in Argentina.
  They are an incredible NGO, working tirelessly to better the lives of
  children living in care in Argentina. As you can imagine, children and
  young people growing up outside of family environments, in large
  instutional care in Argentina, face a number of challenges. Doncel is
  there to support them on their road to independence - providing
  support with securing employment and training for caregivers. I saw
  first hand the massive impact Doncel's work has on the lives of young
  people living in care and know that every contribution will make a difference. For more information on Doncel, you can check out their website: http://doncel.org.ar/ Vicky's triathlon will include a 500m swim, 20 mile cycle and 5k
  run. Ben's marathon is a hard 26 miles of incredibly tough hills! Muchas gracias for your support! Vicky and Ben xx",https://fundrazr.com/c12jS3
315,Help launch Marigold Whole Life Centre,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,4,13%,"The Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) reports that mental
  illness indirectly affects all Canadians at some time through a family
  member, friend or colleague and that 20% of Canadians will personally
  experience a mental illness in their lifetime. Almost one half (49%)
  of those who feel they have suffered from depression or anxiety have
  never gone to see a doctor about this problem. The stigma and
  discrimination attached to mental illnesses presents a serious barrier
  to not only treatment, but also to acceptance in the community.
  However, once depression is recognized, help can make a difference for
  80% of people who are affected, allowing them to get back to their
  regular activities. Statistics Canada reports that in 2013, 23.0% of Candians aged 15 and
  older (6.6 million people) reported that most days were 'quite a bit'
  or 'extremely' stressful. Stress carries several negative health
  consequences including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, as
  well as immune and circultory complications. Exposure to stress can
  also contribute to behaviours such as smoking, overconsumption of
  alcohol, and less-healthy eating habits. In Canada, productivity
  losses in the form of short-term disability days due to depression, or
  to depression and distress combined, were estimated at $2.6 billion in 1998. Current statistics show that mental health is an area of concern not
  only for adults, but also for our children and youth. CMHA reports
  that 11% of kids currently have an ADHD diagnosis. This is a 42%
  increase over the last 8 years and 61% of those diagnosed with ADHD
  are being treated with medication. In addition, 5% of children are
  clinically obese; 10-20% of Canadian Youth have a mental illness and
  70% of youth report it started in childhood; suicide is the second
  leading cause of youth death after accidents; 54% of children will
  have a chronic illness or a risk factor for one, before the age of 17. We strongly believe, that with compassionate integrated care and
  support, individuals and families experiencing the effects of stress
  and mental health issues can move towards optimal wellness. Our
  mission is to effectively support the wellness needs of our clients by
  offering the highest quality physical, mental, emotional, and
  spiritual care.  Our core services include nutrition consulting,
  individual and family counselling, and spiritually integrated psychotherapy. The practitioners of Marigold Whole Life Centre - Pamela Kesselring,
  Catherine Lauber and Gillian Inksettter - are a dedicated team,
  working with the client to provide personalized solutions for whole
  person health and wellbeing. Marigold Whole Life Centre is a business
  ventrure of Revelation of the Spirit, and will be a sanctuary for
  wellbeing, focusing on the interconnections between mental health,
  spiritual health, and nutritional health. We will be opening the
  centre in the Summer of 2015, and are currently raising money to help
  fund the start up of this centre.  Our goal is to raise $2,500 through
  this campaign.  Additional investment opportunities are available to
  those wishing to invest in this social enterprise.",https://fundrazr.com/710bRa
"1,375",Jimmy is going to Everest!,Australian Dollar,,of $10k goal,15,14%,"Why I am going to Mt Everest... Come March 2016 I will be embarking on a self-funded expedition
  of Mt Everest in an attempt to create much needed awareness of my Aunt
  Tanya's story and condition. Fundraising from my expedition is planned
  to benefit her profoundly. Tanya's story is yet another example that troubles can impact
  anyone, no one is immune or safe from unexpected happenings. In a
  world moving so quickly my goal was to make people sit back and take
  notice, appreciate this world and each other. They don't come as bold
  and as challenging as Everest. Please take the time to share the story below. In June 2014 my Aunt Tanya went into hospital for routine
  surgery, she unfortunately had a reaction to the anaesthetic she was
  given, she suffered a stroke to her Brain Stem which resulted in her
  being sedated. When Tanya woke her life changed forever, she was
  unfortunately diagnosed with the rare condition, Locked in Syndrome.
  To paint a clear picture, imagine knowing, seeing, hearing everything
  around you but you are in complete paralysis, you cannot move any part
  of your body, you are unable to talk, swallow or eat yet your sight,
  hearing and brain function remain in check. It's a horrible thought
  however this is now life for my Aunt Tanya. Most sufferers of Locked
  in Syndrome have also experienced a stroke and sufferers rarely
  survive after 6 months. Tanya is a miracle and she is doing great
  considering. One of the biggest lessons through watching her struggles
  is the love between her and husband Michael, every day Michael is by
  her side ensuring she is comfortable, making sure the bed is
  positioned correctly, the TV is tuned into her favourite station or
  her favourite music is playing. Love has a way of teaching us things
  about life and the love I have seen on display throughout this
  situation has taught me a lot. Tanya has now been placed in Barton
  House, run by SA Care. She has settled in well and the staff there are
  fantastic. I aim to raise enough money to purchase a vehicle suitable
  for wheel chair access. This would give Tanya a much improved quality
  of life. She will be able to get outside in touch with nature,
  something she loved doing, it will definitely put a smile on her face. So! Why Everest? Tanya was as adventurous as they come, her and Michael met
  while Michael lived and worked in the US, they would spend most
  weekends exploring, hiking, snowshoeing, deep winter camping and rock
  climbing through the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. An adventurer at
  heart she would have loved to have seen the sites and grandeur Everest
  has to offer. I will be trekking through a foreign country that is still
  recovering from the terrible earthquakes of April 2015. I will be one
  of the first to reach Everest since the earth quakes which is a danger
  in its own due to the fresh snow and ice on the glaciers that hasn’t
  seen human foot traffic in over 12 months. I am prepared to take on the challenge, those that know me well
  know that I complete everything I set out to do, so I hope I can
  complete this mission and raise some money and awareness, I appreciate
  your time checking out my fundraising page and thank you for reading
  Tanya's story. ""Doing it for Tanya""",https://fundrazr.com/b10pwc

"6,785",Help Nerd Girl Yarns Move to a New Studio,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,109,68%,"Nerd Girl Yarns has outgrown the business use of the family home and needs to expand to a commercial studio. Relocating to a new studio would mean not only more yarn & fiber in the colors you love but opening the studio for fiber arts education to the community. Rather than increase order fulfillment times, continue to cap clubs at lower levels, miss festivals, and discourage the interest yarn shops have had in carrying Nerd Girl Yarns colorways we need to be able to expand. We want to continue to put our customers first, encourage the fiber arts & so we need help moving. We not only want to provide the colorways you have come to know and love but want to share the artistic expression and technical application of fiber arts with others. In 2012 we offered special items for a small fundraiser to move the dye lab from the living room and kitchen of our home into our basement. We thought this would keep everything running smoothly but Nerd Girls and Guys are so awesome that it's already too small. Our basement suffers from the same problems other 100 year old homes do and unfortunately that means three-fourths of it floods every time it rains so we can't use any additional space down there. We can’t run water and pots on our attic because we are out of power draw & the building won’t support that use - plus it gets 100 degrees up there. Neither of these places are great for hosting students or visitors either. The commercial space will be located in our rural hometown of Odessa, MO outside of Kansas City. There are several buildings for rent in our downtown area & we are ready to sign a lease but we need to ensure we can afford the leasehold improvements & new steamers & ovens before we start paying rent on a building we can’t utilize yet. The space will have enough floor space to setup a small shop front, a fiber studio, office space, shipping space, and a dye lab. In addition to being able to add dye pots to expand our ever growing business, we would like to be able to offer the space to fiber arts groups for meetups, host yarn crawls, and offer dye & spinning classes. We want to be able to share our love of fiber and the community that Nerd Girls and Guys have built with as many folks as possible & continue promote innovations in fiber. The money we raise will be used to help make our new space a functioning studio & lab. We need to install two double tub sinks, a new oven, counters, more steam/cook pans, cooling racks, additional drying racks and all the plumbing and electrical parts, inspections and labor to support the facility and equipment. We plan on using as much reclaimed and repurposed materials as possible. We have some fabulous incentives for you if you can help us out! These are even better than before and we plan on starting by not only offering one-of-a-kind yarn & NGY logo’ed items but studio time with one-on-one instruction! Not all of the incentives will have amount buttons on the Give page, please fill out the amount if your choice does not have a button. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you can donate $1: You will receive updates and the inside scoop on the progress of this project & a thank you email.

Nerd Girls & Guys are the best anywhere hands down and I know that you will come through for us! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Some questions and answers! Why are we crowdfunding instead of getting a loan? We don’t want to be in debt. Since I started Nerd Girl Yarns in 2010 I have always used the resources I had and turned profits back into the business for growth. I would rather give back to my supporters and know my investors than give interest to unknown faces behind a lending institution additionally borrowing faster than a business can support is a reason businesses fail. By only investing with what I have available I ensure I don’t bite off more than I can chew and end up closing due to bad financial decisions. I purchase all of my supplies and equipment with cash and plan on continuing to do so. The problem remains that we can’t afford an empty studio until we can fix it up & we can’t keep going without a studio so we have come to you for help. Why should you donate to a for profit business? We are not asking for your charity, we are asking for your investment in our future. We want you to be a part of our lives and our business. You are not donating or giving away money, we are providing goods & services in exchange for a fee just like we do in our shop except we are offering special things we don’t normally carry in our shop in hopes to raise the money faster for this specific project as it has a short timeline. Supporting small businesses helps families and communities grow and thrive & we plan on giving back with the new studio space by sharing our space with groups and our knowledge with anyone who wants to come and learn it. When will I receive my items? Once we meet our initial goal we will be able to start work on the studio. Once the infrastructure and remodeling is complete and we can move in we will begin to start working on the one-of-a-kind colorways, the special order colorways, the handspun, the studio days and all the fun stuff. I will communicate with all the investors to keep everyone in the loop. Some things will take longer than others but being fiber folk I know you guys will all understand that stuff :) We will contact you within two business days of your donation about any specifics and to let you know we really appreciate you. Will my club discount work for this? Unfortunately it does not. FundRazr is a separate system than the NGY shop & offering discounts on investments changes how the project works plus the fees for using the service cut into the amounts received already. Thanks for understanding.",https://fundrazr.com/2X8h7

"1,441",The Mind-Body Makeover,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,22,57%,"Howdy. Thanks for creating space in your day to listen to my story.
  My name is Christy. And I'm a yoga teacher. One of the many ways I
  define myself. In this great mystery of life. Very recently, I was
  immensely blessed. With an amazing opportunity. Two inspiring,
  supportive women - Alissa and Diane - offered me a yoga studio. To
  take over. And Transform. There was the briefest flicker of a moment - with fear - that I felt
  paralyzed by all the ""what if's"" - of turning entrepreneur.
  But then my practice met me off the mat - faith and hope flew to my
  sides transforming the energy of fear - and I said Yes! Big. Full.
  Luscious. Salivating. YES!!!! Because this is one of my many dreams - manifested into reality. By a
  string of serendipitous events - divinely guided. Indeed. And so, because this was an unplanned, off-the-cuff kind of offering
  - I am here. To beseech you. To inspire you. To offer you the
  opportunity to contribute your green energy to a space where others
  can learn the practice of surrender, surrendering to truth, faith,
  trust, hope and the power of love. Because that's where I learned. Began to practice. And started to
  understand the language and energy of transformation. On my mat. In
  the yoga studio. And that's where I want to continue sharing that
  gift, from all my teachers onto all the students who will pass through
  that door, up those stairs and onto that floor. Deep belly breaths of transformation. So I'm here. Asking for some very practical needs to be met. The
  studio needs funding for the basics: Mats - 150 Blankets - 100 Straps -150 Blocks - 150 Bolsters -200 Laptop/Ipad - 600 Website - 400 Decor - Eye of Henna Mural, curtains, lights, plants, etc. - 800 In Shapleigh, the next-door neighbor to Sanford, the Mind-Body Studio
  is ready to shed its skin and transform. With your green energy
  support, myself and all those currently teaching and/or practicing in
  the space, are ready to strengthen the pulse of consciousness raising
  energy in the Western Maine/NH area. This area is calling for a shift.
  And the Mind-Body Studio is answering that call. Answer with us.",https://fundrazr.com/d12fK4

  spread that love & warmth to thousands of people in Oregon &
  Washington and beyond by helping expand our business. Debra's Custom Machine Quilting is owned and operated by my sister
  Debra Burchett & myself (Mike Sanderson).  Quilting is a passion
  passed down from our Grandparents.  We've shared our family's love of
  quilting with hundreds of people in the US and in several countries
  around the world.  And we've done it all working out of our homes. Its time for our business to expand into a retail shop where people
  can actually see the quilts being made start to finish; where they can
  bring their own completed quilt tops and have them long-arm machine
  quilted by a Master Quilter free motion with patterns that enhance the
  quilt.  Debra is a true artist with the long-arm quilting machine and
  people love to watch her work.  It's magical to see her take a nice
  quilt top and make it spectacular. The timing of our expansion comes partly in response to my losing my
  job of 20 years as a Program Manager of a group home for
  Developmentally Disabled Adults.  A new Executive Director ended my
  opportunity to teach and encourage disabled individuals to learn new
  skills and experience the world the way you and I do.  I was blessed
  with that 20 year career but now its time to give back in a new way. The money we raise will be used to move our business into a permanent
  home open to the public; to provide space for teaching quilting and to
  display our quilts so that they may be enjoyed and even purchased by
  people just like you. Please, help us out if you can. Every little bit helps.  Also, please

600,Support Innovative Education & Development Startup,Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,4,6%,"Talamanca Interactive Education Experiences is a Canadian based
  social enterprise that makes nature your classroom. We operate out of
  the beautiful Talamanca mountains in Costa Rica, partnering with local
  tourism entrepreneurs who are trying to make a living for themselves
  and their families through ecotourism. Through engaging student
  travelers on environmental, social and economic themes, we strive to
  not only strengthen the local economy but inspire tomorrow's leaders
  to be environmentally and socially conscious consumers and citizens. As a new social enterprise venture, we are seeking out support to
  help us raise start-up funds to spread the word. We are two young Canadians, Allison and Heather, who live and work in
  Turrialba, an agricultural region that is not known for the booming
  eco-tourism like other parts of the country. We fell in love with the
  region for its mountains, beautiful rivers, friendly people and
  authentic Costa Rican lifestyle.  But we saw the challenges the region
  was having too, environmentally, socially and economically.  Families
  with incomes based solely on agriculture are struggling, and the most
  innovative are trying to turn to tourism as a solution.  At the same
  time, eco-tourism companies are struggling due to a lack of promotion
  of the region and limited marketing experience, and as result are at
  risk of failing. What is Talamanca Experiences all about? We saw that bringing the right kind of tourism to the area could make
  a meaningful and positive impact to the region.  At the same time,
  providing some basic business coaching could help entrepreneurs stand
  on their own two feet. Talamanca was built as a means to build the capacities of rural
  entrepreneurs, create a network amongst local partners, to share
  information and advice and promote their offerings to Canadian high
  schools and universities. So far, we have brought together a group of extremely passionate,
  innovative and environmentally conscious rural entrepreneurs, who got
  engaged in tourism to help diversify their incomes while living in
  harmony with nature. Together, over a series of workshops, we have
  designed Sustainability Strategy Plans and helped strengthen each
  business through advice and development with the network's synergies
  in mind. Why students? Students are the government employees, business people,
  lawyers, foresters and consumers of tomorrow. We believe that
  education is key to building a more informed, conscious and
  sustainable global society, so our trips are dedicated to providing
  students at the high school and university levels with practical
  experiences based on the same curriculum they are learning in school.
  We put put textbook theory into field practice. We believe that this
  type of interactive learning, combined with a new culture and exciting
  confidence-building experiences inspires students to change the way
  they see the world and their place in it. How to Contribute: Purchase a beautiful artisanal product from our campaign for
    yourself or to give as a gift.  Included will be a story about the
    product and its maker. Share our page with your family, friends, and colleagues. Your generous contribution to the campaign will pay a fair price to
  the local Costa Rica producers and artisans, with the remaining going
  towards marketing to reach out more students and schools and design
  more educational experiences. Finally, each group that comes on a trip with us helps rais funds to
  put towards specific community sustainability projects identified with
  our partners, local Universities, local government and NGO groups. 
  For example, sewage and used water treatment, green energy projects,
  capacity building for entrepreneurs, English skills and resume building. We welcome your comments and feedback, introductions and ideas. Reach

485,Help a 12 year old Break the Sound Barrier,Australian Dollar,,of $25k goal,16,2%,"Project ThunderStruck set to Break Barriers by Robert Brand This project is two projects in one. The total aim of ThunderStruck
  is to build as small a space craft as possible that will handle
  reentry, remain stable and land softly. The ""softly"" is
  important as commercially there are payloads that may need to be
  conducted in a ""weightless"" environment and then be brought
  down without too much jarring. A parachute landing will not be
  suitable. My son who is very aerospace savvy was keen to be involved
  in some way and Project ThunderStruck was born. We will help do the
  low altitude testing - when I say low, i mean from 40Km altitude (25 miles) Imagine a time when a 12 year student could design and build a
  supersonic glider 2.5m / 8ft long, attach it to a huge helium or
  hydrogen balloon and take it to the edge of space, release it, fly it
  into a dive back to earth that will reach Mach 1.5 / 1,800kph /
  1,120mph and land it. Well that time is now and the student is Jason
  Brand from Sydney Secondary College / Balmain Campus. He is in year 7
  and has already broken plenty of records with his hobbies. Breaking
  the sound barrier will be another cool record. New Science, New Data, New Opportunities Apart from the glitz of the big event in 6 months (a 12-year-old
  breaking the sound barrier) there is a lot of science being done. In
  fact the event side of this project will be funded by sponsors and the
  crowd funding will be for the additional science outlined below. There is a commercial opportunity to design and create a winged
  re-entry vehicle specifically for delicate payloads and experiments
  that last for more than 4 minutes in a weightless environment (tourist
  sounding flights to space). These are experiments and payloads that
  would find a parachute landing too harsh. There is a final output of
  the work and that is a spacecraft for experiments or even a payload
  taxi service back to earth. The most important aspect of this work is
  determining the smallest size of a winged spacecraft that can remain
  stable during re-entry. There are three stages of the physical testing: Transonic - Project ThunderStruck in 6 months time Reentry from space (delivered on a sounding rocket - no orbit);
    2-3 years away. Re-entry from orbit; 6 years away There are two science components to the upcoming testing over the
  next 6 months: Stability of a small aircraft at mach 1.5 / 1,800kph / 1,120mph
    and lower speeds for landing testing a new type of surface for high-speed flight. (not a heat shield) Since Jason has experience and a fantastic track record in High
  Altitude Balloon flights and flying remote control aircraft, he wanted
  to look after that first phase of the project. The transonic Phase.
  Transonic flight is the flight around the area of breaking the sound
  barrier. All sorts of problems occur near the sound barrier. When we
  drop the aircraft from 40Km altitude, first we have to get through the
  sound barrier as the drag increases significantly, but once through
  the barrier, the drag essentially reduces until your speed increases
  further. The real testing then commences as our tests will be about
  slowing, not increasing speed. We will be measuring the behaviour of
  the craft and airflow over the surfaces. Project ThunderStruck has Commenced Flying Tests Just in case you are concerned that this is all talk and no action,
  we started test flights in Sept 2014. The results are simply amazing
  and we will use them to refine our project. The event will take 6 to 9 months to complete and the testing is the
  most important aspect of this project. It is new territory for us and
  almost the entire world. There is still fresh science to be done and
  innovative ways to use new materials and designs. Recently we learned
  a lot when a non-aerodynamic payload (space chicken from Clintons
  Toyota) reached speeds of 400kph / 250mph with its parachute deployed.
  This is because the air is pretty thin up at 33.33Km or 1/3 the way to
  space. Our payload took several measurements during the fall. The
  space chicken was a simple test and we are now happy that we can
  easily fly at speeds of Mach 1.5 in the very thin air high up in the
  stratosphere. Left is a picture of the chicken falling back to earth
  at 400kph. Even the parachute could not slow the payload in the thin
  air. It slowed down as it reached 28Kms altitude and the air got a bit thicker. We have started fund raising as we need help to cover the costs of
  the science parts of the project. Once we know what we have, we can
  decide on the extent of the program. We need $20,000 or more just for
  science and we have turned to crowd funding for that. We have some “Perks” as part of crowd funding that I hope you will
  love. Some of our payloads will go supersonic before the big event,
  but they will not be aircraft. We might even donate one of our
  supersonic payloads to a generous contributor. STEM - Project ThunderStruck set to Inspire Kids Worldwide. Fighter jets break the sound barrier every day, but this radio
  controlled aircraft has no engine, weighs 9Kg (20lbs), is 2.5m (8 ft)
  long. So the pilot must be a really experience Top Gun to fly this
  plane at 1,800kph (1,120mph)? Well, no. His name is Jason
  Brand and he is 12 years old. This is probably one of the most important demonstrations of STEM
  education that you can support. This is beyond the ability of almost
  every adult on the planet, yet a 12 year old student is set to inspire
  kids around the world with a daring project that is pure STEM
    – Science Technology Engineering Mathematics . It will make
  the seemingly impossible the domain of the young if they choose to
  break down the barriers imposed by themselves or others. Not only
  that, there is real science going on here. Your Assistance is Essential Your crowd funding help now is essential. It gets us started
  immediately. Flying balloons to the edge of space for testing is an
  expensive exercise and we have a 7 hour drive each way to get into
  areas of low air traffic away from the major aircraft trunk routes. We
  also have to buy a lot of radio systems to allow remote control from
  the ground when the glider is up to 100kms distance. You can click on one of the 2 crowd funding links at the top right of
  the page. Even $1 will help unlock new discoveries and bed down older science. Who is Jason Brand? He is a 12 y/o student from Sydney Secondary College, Balmain Campus
  in Sydney, Australia. He carried out his first High Altitude Balloon (HAB) project at age 9
  and was so inspired that he sat for his amateur radio license at 9
  years old. Since then he has launched a total of 19 HAB flights and
  recovered all 19. Some flights were in Croatia where mountains, swamps
  and landmines are risks not seen in Australia. He is also the Student
  Representative for Team Stellar – A Google Lunar X-Prize team
  attempting to get a rover onto the moon. J ason
  appears on Radio and TV regularly and the picture above shows him
  talking about HAB flights on Canberra’s Fuzzy Logic Science Show in
  2013. He is also a member of the Australian Air League, Riverwood
  Squadron. He plans to solo on his 15th birthday. His father Robert Brand is an innovator in creating low cost
  solutions for spaceflight. He speaks regularly at international
  conferences, is a regular guest lecturer on aerospace at Sydney
  University, writes about aerospace and takes a very “hands on”
  approach to space. He supports Jason’s project fully. How will ThunderStruck work? The same way that the first pilots broke the sound barrier: in a
  steep dive. The problem is that since there is no engine and the
  biggest issue is air resistance, Jason will launch the aircraft from
  over 40km altitude or nearly half way to space! He will get it there
  on a high altitude balloon. The air is very thin at that altitude and
  the craft should accelerate past the speed of sound before it is thick
  enough to slow it down. A tiny fraction of one percent of the air at
  sea level. During the dive, the craft will accelerate to well over
  Mach 1 and way less than Mach 2 and will need to be controllable by
  its normal control surfaces to pass as an aircraft. As the air
  thickens at low altitudes, the craft will slow and with the
  application of air brakes will slow and then be levelel off for normal
  flight to the ground. The Technology We will have a camera in the nose of the aircraft and it will
  transmit TV images to the pilot on the ground. Jason will be either in
  a darkened room with a monitor or wearing goggles allowing him to see
  the view from the on-board camera. This provides what is known as
  First-person Point of View (FPV). The aircrafts instruments will be
  overlaid on the video signal. This is known as “On Screen Display” or
  OSD. Below is a view typical of what will be seen by Jason as he lands
  the craft. The
  video signal must travel over 100kms to be assured of the craft being
  in the radius of the equipments limits. Similarly we must send
  commands to the control surfaces of the radio controlled aircraft.
  Again this must work at a distance of over 100kms. The craft has
  ailerons, elevators and rudder as well as air-breaks and other systems
  that need controlling. We will use a 10 channel system to ensure that
  we have full control of every aspect of the craft and a
  ""binding"" system will ensure that only we can fly the aircraft. We will have to buy 2 x $5,000 GPS unit capable of sampling at what
  is essentially the speed of a missile. These are highly restricted
  items, but essential. The unit will record to an SD card and send back
  telemetry every second. It is essential to know the speed during the
  flight rather than waiting until after the event. After all Jason
  needs to knowthe speed to be able to fly the aircraft. We will also
  need 2 x radar responders to allow other aircraft and air traffic
  controllers to know where our craft is and our balloon is at any time. The Big Event We can expect global TV News coverage of the event and many records
  to be broken. The day will start by filling a large Zero Pressure
  Balloon like the one pictured below. The
  balloon will carry the aircraft to over 40km where it will be released
  and go into a steep dive and break the sound barrier. As the air
  thickens, the speed will slow and the craft will be pulled out of the
  dive and leveled off to drop speed. The aircraft will eventually land
  and data and video records will be recovered. We will already know the
  top speed, but there is nothing like solid data rather than radio
  telemetry that may miss the odd data packet. Both the balloon and the
  aircraft will be transmitting live video. There will be opportunities to attend, but it is likely to be in a
  rather remote part of the state (NSW, Australia) or a nearby state.
  The flight will be broadcast over the Internet and the opportunity to
  track and follow the flight will be available to all. The chance to be
  involved is high and the science and inspiration will be out of this
  world. Project ThunderStruck is set to thrill. Visit our sister site wotzup.com for more space and balloon stories Featured • Airframe • Balloons • Cost/Budget • Overview • Speed • Technology",https://fundrazr.com/csRBb
301,"Fight global warming, unique solar water heating",Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,3,3%,"FIGHT TO REDUCE POLLUTION AND GLOBAL WARMING We can work together The sun can heat your water, save you money and reduce green house gas emissions that warm the planet. Twenty years ago I invented a non-electric circulating pump. I closed my architectural practice to devote my time to developing this pump for use in solar water heating systems. With the financial help of some friends and relatives and a few early customers the R & D and development work is now completed and a number of prototype pumps are in service. Here's how it works. The pump circulates a fluid in a closed loop heat transfer system wherein heat is added at a high place and removed at a lower place. This is what happens in active solar water heating systems where the heat source is the solar collectors on the roof and the water to be heated is below in a storage tank. (See full explanation and videos of working prototypes on our website) There you will see our latest installation on a car wash as shown above where in four summer months of 2012 it saved 74% of the energy that was used in previous years to heat the same amount of water. You can also see one of our smaller systems on the solar water heating section of Wikipedia where it rates the highest among five other types of systems. The unique feature of this pump is that it is powered by the heat of the sun and requires no other energy source to overcome the convective forces and friction within the systems. Traditional active solar water heating uses electric pumps that require a temperature sensor, a controller, wiring, an expansion tank, a source of electrical power and a qualified electrician to install them. By eliminating these costly and failure-prone components the bubble pump reduces the cost of solar water heating and also makes it available in regions that lack a reliable electrical grid. The bubble pump will similarly make solar air conditioning less costly and independent of the power grid. Because our system has no moving parts to wear out we call it SOL Perpetua. With your contributions we will immediately buy the tooling and materials and  labour to make pumps. As more funds become available both from the sale of these first pumps added to more contributions from people who care we will develop higher efficiency and lower cost collectors and a storage tank that gives over-temperature protection and space heating ability. The testing and approvals for these components will take perhaps two years. To thank you for contributing to our start-up, for every dollar you give now you will receive a two dollar discount when you buy one of our first pumps or the later entire systems. This discount is transferable to anyone you wish. In addition to your donation or even if you cannot make a donation we ask you to send an email to your representative in government asking him or her to campaign for the elimination of the subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear energy so that clean and safe renewable energy technologies can have a chance.

240,Building a medieval LARP village in East Anglia.,Pound Sterling,,of £100k goal,8,0%,"Wouldn’t you like to have a permanent medieval-style village to
  enable you to fully express your LARP or other fantasy persona to its
  fullest? We know the answer is “YES” so let’s get started. Imagine you, and a few friends, have just arrived at the portal into
  a magical world. You leave behind anything that is overtly post
  sixteenth century and enter dressed in your finest adventurers’
  clothing with your campaign bag of trail rations and other items
  necessary for your journey. After walking a short way you start to
  smell smoke. Your eyes scan the woods around you looking for signs of
  fire, but see nothing, so you continue on your way. Moments later, you
  round a bend in the track and see the source of the smoke. There, a
  short way off, is a small village with tendrils of sweet wood-smoke
  gently trailing from the rooves of some of the buildings. You decide to investigate this tranquil little hamlet further and
  walk down the track leading straight towards it. As you approach you
  start to notice details about the buildings you see, the first of
  which appears to be an inn. A wooden sign hangs outside with a rough
  painting of a foaming mug of ale upon it. “Not a bad place to get some
  information,” you all think, so in you go to find a pleasant-looking
  bar. There are a couple of patrons enjoying a meal in one corner and a
  small group enjoying a drink and a song or two at a large circular
  table in the centre of the room. A sturdy counter stretches along the
  wall to the rear of the bar. A quick look at your companions is all
  you need to decide the bartender would be a likely source for the
  information you need. “Well met, my friends!” declares the bartender as you approach.
  “First time in Balinoria? If you’re looking to stay a while there are
  a couple of options I can take you through?” You glance at the others and get an encouraging nod from everyone
  “Why not?” you say. “Okay.” begins the bartender, “There are three options for short stay
  accommodation in Balinoria, the cheapest is basically free and has
  stunning views of the night sky or, as I like to call it, ‘sleeping
  rough’. There are trees hereabout who like nothing more than having a
  cheapskate freebooter curl up at thier base, wrapped in a cloak
  snoring like a hog! “The second option, my personal favourite, is to spend your stay here
  at my wonderful inn, ‘The Foaming Mug’ where you will enjoy the
  camaraderie of sharing the common quarters above the stables around
  the back. You get your own cot and footlocker for a very reasonable
  nightly fee. “The third option, a popular one with you adventuring types, is to
  rent one of the empty properties in the village with your own cooking
  facilities and separate rooms for boys and girls!” Your first choice appears to be an easy one but you are sure that
  during your stay they will get harder - and - more rewarding. Not a bad start to any adventure we’d say but of course no village
  would seem believable without a fair number of NPCs - all ready to
  interact with you, or leave you alone as you see fit. Is there an
  adventure to be had? Surely. Are there villainous characters out to
  lighten your purse and/or treasure chest? Of course. Will there be
  plenty of excuses to loosen your sword in its sheath or test your
  skill with the bow? Well, what kind of adventure would it be without such? The time spent in Balinoria will be a rich and deep immersion in a
  fantasy world that you and your companions will never tire of. There
  will also be the inevitable opportunities to buy new equipment; get
  instruction in the dark arts of archery and dare we say it, axe

  your budget. A quick word on just who we are and why we care so much about this
  project. The 'we' is History Blooms, a company that has been teaching
  the world how to shoot traditional archery for four years now both at
  our own ranges, currently situated on the edge of Bures on the
  Essex/Suffolk border, and at many historic events throughout the
  country from Speke Hall in Liverpool to the Mary Rose Trust in
  Portsmouth. We are passionate about the medieval world, and the 14th
  century in particular, and have gathered to us a band of like-minded
  individuals to help portray the lives and work of the common man under
  the strict guidance of our Lord, Lionel de Bradenham of Langenhoe. So
  why a LARP facility you ask? As much as our interests lie in the
  medieval period most of us have been drawn to this via our reading and
  film interests and like you find the freedom of the fantasy world very
  appealing. Our leader in the this project is Mark Bloom, co-founder of
  History Blooms, and now also Managing Director of Toxic Archery, and
  his favourite book of all time is the wonderful Magician by Raymon E
  Feist. Mark has read this book at least once a year since it was
  published and even took a copy with him on military deployments and,
  later, scientific expeditions around the world. The rest of the team
  are similar in their addictions to quasi-medieval literature. Thank you in advance and we hope to see and share our vision with you
  all soon.",https://fundrazr.com/e15Lu1
400,"Help Us Create a ""Second Chance"" Training Facility",Canadian Dollar,,of $20k goal,4,2%,"Hello Everyone! When people ask me how long The Essential Bakery has been open, I find it
  isn't as straight-forward as an anniversary date. You see, I didn't
  originally open The Essential Bakery to be a full-time bakery. I
  actually opened this location under a different name, as a Holistic
  Nutrition Center with just a basic home-kitchen for cooking classes
  and to bake for clients. Within 2 weeks however, this location took on a life of its own. I
  outgrew my original kitchen equipment, my business took on a new name
  to reflect the change to a full-time bakery, and with 2 further
  upgrades-a second oven and a large 10 Qt mixer, it is now a bustling
  kitchen most days of the week. As The Essential Bakery approaches it's 2-year
  anniversary this February 1st, I look to what is ahead not only for my
  little bakery as a business but also how my professional background
  can be combined with this food service path that sort-of ""found
  me"", to make a tangible difference in the world. I am reminded of the principles that have always guided my business: #1: Serve whatever needs a person presents first, and then provide
  them food second. Even though this is technically a food-service
  business, it is human interaction that I believe is the greater point
  of the food industry as a whole. When we eat at a restaurant for
  example, it is the experience and company we are with that ultimately
  makes the evening memorable. No matter how good the food, if you are
  eating it alone-it just isn't the same thing. Every person who comes into my micro bakery is treated as an
  important member of a COMMUNITY. I make it a point to offer help that
  goes beyond the scope of a ""baker"" as often as possible,
  because I believe that food may open the door, but human connection
  should be the point of all we do. #2: Love good food. Do it well. Do it from love. Do it as an act of
  service and with the deliberate intention to nourish every cell in
  each customer's body. #3: Seek the higher purpose in every encounter. There are few things
  more important than our Purpose. Some of us know what that is
  practically from birth, while others seek it slowly and in an indirect
  fashion. I was called to serve people at the tender age of 6, and set
  my mind on becoming a missionary at age 12. I went into full-time
  ministry at age 17, and while my path has taken some interesting turns
  and detours, I have spent a good deal of time since leaving the
  ministry in service of some kind to my fellow human beings. It is time to bring The Essential Bakery into the same Purpose. The VISION: My missionary and communications work took me around the world
  experiencing food in many different cultures. Aside from the diversity
  our human species shares when it comes to WHAT we eat, one of the most
  interesting aspects of these travels was to see how gathering around a
  table to share a meal was a point of community focus regardless of
  country, culture or social status. Sharing food together marks time,
  heals relationships, celebrates events, creates community, bonds new
  families, settles feuds and so much more. It is this sense of community that drives me. Creating food is a fundamentally healing process. It's the reason so
  many cultural practices centre around the preparation and consumption
  of food. I want to begin to involve marginalized people in my business; Unwed mothers looking for in-demand skills to begin their
    professional lives. Women leaving abusive situations who are starting over and need
    work experience to be able to set themselves free. A young person without a supportive family who needs direction-a
    way to unleash their creativity and be a part of a community. A retired person with many years of work experience who misses
    being needed-being useful. THE PLAN: Step 1: Renovate the existing space to allow for seating, and to add
  a needed stove/ventilation system. Step 2: Develop a skills-aquisition program that will take a
  participant through a particular number of weeks and teach them a
  well-rounded set of skills they can take into the workforce. Step 3: Create collaborative relationships with local non-profits and
  community resources to develop a work-education program and to locate
  the right people to extend this opportunity to. Step 4: Explore the possibility of becoming a not-for-profit, a
  branch of a government-funded program or establish on-going
  fundraising/philanthropic sponsorship to support the training/wage of participants. WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE FUNDS: To begin, basic construction: We need to remove/move a couple of walls, refloor and re-do lighting,
  purchase equipment such as a Stove and commercial dishwasher, as well
  as add a second bathroom which is required by health code. We will also need to build/purchase seating appropriate for a
  small-space, and a vertical product display unit-as my current counter
  uses up a lot of valuable floor space. And finally, whatever remains will go toward the purchase of items
  for the cafe area of the facility such as dishes, cutlery, glasses,
  cloth napkins decor and other sundries. Please join this COMMUNITY of people wanting to make a difference by
  adding your energy and support in the form of donations to our fund! You can follow the progress of this project on our Wix site . And watch as things begin to unfold in
  the Spring or Summer of 2016. We look forward to sharing our journey
  and the success stories you are an integral part in soon!",https://fundrazr.com/c14hKa

125,Help The Flour Dog Grow Our Commercial Kitchen!,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,1,1%,"The Flour Dog started as the dream of two 23-year-old girls in
  Fayetteville, AR. We are simple people with huge goals. One baker and
  one graphic designer. When we first moved to Fayetteville, we just wanted to find a
  good place to eat-- Somewhere that could provide a meal that was GOOD
  for us, and that we could be happy about spending our money
  on with a limited budget. After 2 years of searching the incredible culture of Northwest
  Arkansas without finding just the right place for us, we realized... We are going to have to be the ones to make it! And you know what? We want our dogs to be able to come, too. Our goal is to provide a cafe-bakery that serves wholesome original recipes at a fair price, where
  friends can bring their dogs to enjoy a good
  meal and a warm cup of coffee . Each donation gets us one step closer to making The Flour Dog a
  reality in our local Fayetteville neighborhood. We aim to source most
  of our ingredients locally in order to give
    back to our economy and keep Fayetteville in our roots as
  we continue to grow and blossom. Today we are seeking a commercial kitchen to start
  providing The Flour Dog food to the world that we love. At first, we
  tried selling our products on our website, but we feared we would
  run into issues with FDA regulations about making food from our home
  kitchen. Our solution? We've got to find the right place to cook! These donations will all go towards funding an FDA-Approved
    Commercial Kitchen for our business. Our options include a
  food truck, a small standalone building, or any commercial property
  that houses the proper equipment for food production and storage. Once we get our kitchen, we can start making profits to grow our
  business and provide even more opportunities to our community and our
  friends. Every penny that comes this way goes into The Flour Dog fund. Would you like to help us bring The Flour Dog to
  Fayetteville? Every voice counts! You can help by sharing
  this on your Facebook and Twitter, telling your friends about The
  Flour Dog, or submitting a donation to this page. Thank you all for
  your support!",https://fundrazr.com/a161w2

  communications for the system users. The Salinas Valley Repeater Group system consists of 12 open and
  linked repeaters in California, from the Santa Cruz mountains to the

183,Help Cat Write a Book,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,6,4%,"For years, everyone has been telling me ""Cat, I love your blog -
  publish a book!"" and for years I've been saying ""I will,
  just let me get around to it."" I'd love to write a book for
  publication, but writing an article for my blog often takes time from
  me that I can barely afford to donate - and that's just me writing a
  few pages. It's unfortunate - I have to work literally almost twice as much as
  the average full-time-employed person to break even - I chose a very
  low-paying, high-stress field of work for myself - occultist and
  practitioner of the occult arts is not really some dashing, well-paid
  job like some people might think. While I do love my job, it doesn't
  afford me much time to write, and having had some medical problems in
  the last 3 years (I spent more than my entire years' earnings in 2012
  on medical bills,) didn't exactly simplify keeping a savings. :( It came to me one evening - if I could just get about 1-2 months off
  of work (and by that I mean, I'd work 5 hour days instead of 14 hour
  days,) I could definitely find the time to complete a book. What I'd
  require isn't just time - it's a comfortable enough financial shoulder
  to be able to ensure I can spare that time. Since my income can
  fluctuate wildly (one week, I'll make 3 weeks' income, another week, I
  make negative $750,) it's been difficult to save that amount for
  myself for any reason, but if I could have a little help.... And that's where you come in. :) See, the way I see it is that I need a certain amount
  ""saved"" to do this work, and once I have it, I'll be in a
  financially-better position to begin my literary journey, and
  most-likely never require this assistance again. I'll be getting an
  income from my first book, also working, and therefore able to make
  time for a second book (because income from the first book,) and then
  a third book, and so on and so forth, until I'm living the
  modern-occultist's dream (which is mostly, - outside of doing
  occult-things - to write and speak at conventions.) While I've done my research and located a few publishing houses that
  I find respectable (implied: they don't publish pulpy mainstream
  occult-disinformation books,) who I'm sure would be willing to publish
  a manuscript for me (even in a nice hard bound volume!) my next need
  is money and time. Since time = money, I need donations. So, if you'd all like me to publish a book, put your money where your
  mouth (hands? most of you communicated via type) is (are,) and let me
  know by helping me make enough to keep the lights on, feed the pets,
  keep my stuff from getting repossessed, and keep the heat on at my
  house while I complete the manuscript. The suggested amount should be
  enough to cover my needs for ~2 months if I work ""part time""
  (approximately full time for a regular person, lol,) at my current job. As a bonus, if you donate $500, I will personally send you a
  personalized and signed copy of my book when it is published. Keep in
  mind, publishing is not a ""this is happening tomorrow"" sort
  of deal, and that could mean months (even a year) from today. Please
  be sure to make sure I have your contact information handy. :) QUESTIONS YOU PROBABLY HAVE: 1. How close is this to being finished? a. Basically I have a really battered copy of something I wrote 7
  years ago that needs a good clean up and redo. (That's a nice way of
  saying about 1/3 of it is salvagable, the rest needs to be rewritten.)
  1-2 months is a generous amount of time for me to complete this process. 2. What is the topic of the book? a. A primer on useful spellcraft, with chapters devoted to rituals
  you can do for yourself on the topics of love/reconciliation,
  money/business, cursing/controlling spells, and also miscelaneous spells. 3. Is it a formulary? a. No. I might put a few formulas in there, but it isn't a formulary. 4. I hate PayPal - can you accept credit cards by phone like you do
  at work? a. Yes, we just need to get on the phone for that. :) 5. Can I still get the personalized and signed book if I use credit
  card by phone? a. Yes, I will be happy to oblige. 6. What if I donate and no one publishes your book? a. I've had several requests from publishers looking for a book from
  me for about 10 years now, I could self-publish if I wanted to (but I
  don't unless it's my only option,) and even the ""big"" occult
  houses have attempted to solicit me for a book. My 2 problems have
  been ridiculous editing (large mainstream publisher,) and time/money
  constraints (see above,) so I'm going to take a gamble here and say if
  I wanted to, I could publish something right now by just sticking
  parts of my blog together, and get it published. What I'm offering here is something wholly new, not available on my
  blog, and something you've all been asking for. If worse came to
  worst, I can self-publish it, then personally inscribe a copy and sign
  it for my backers. HOWEVER, I'd rather give you a fancy hardbound
  edition from a really nice publisher, which I'm pretty certain I could accomplish. 7. If I donate will you dedicate the book to me? a. I would be more that happy to acknowledge someone who made a large
  contribution in the acknowledgements section. :) Now, as an added bonus, if I don't get near my goal, you can all
  remind me of that the next time I get a big ol ego about being
  awesome. ;) Also, you can wait another 5-10 years for me to get a
  f***ing book complete, lol. ;) If you have questions, you can always contact me and ask away. ~Cat",https://fundrazr.com/0vl69

260,Ban the bumb (builder's bum) + belly and back,Pound Sterling,,of £5k goal,5,5%,"My name is Sarah and I formed the product design company: Another
  Great Idea Ltd in 2011 (currently dormant as developing prototypes) as
  I realised I have always invented and I have the conviction that my
  ideas are unique and could be popular and successful. The product I am putting forth first is Backuppz. I don't have a
  problem admitting I experience builder's bum more often than I would
  like. I find it embarrassing and so I set about finding a solution.
  What I came up with is Backuppz. Backuppz is essentially a modesty panel for the 3 B’s: your back,
  belly and bum (+ builder’s bum). It is not shapewear; it merely covers
  the parts you don’t want to be seen and/or that need protecting from
  chilly conditions. Once I wore it for the first time I was really happy it covered my
  belly too, as many women can attest, after a certain age that's all we
  complain about! :) Funnily enough, when I went to get samples made, the tailor is a
  builder on the side (!) and he said builder's don't care about their
  builder's bum (shock, horror) but what they do care about is their
  lower backs being cold. I had NO idea this was a problem and many
  others have since talked about wanting to warm that part of their body. It's been a while in development mainly because I have not had the
  funds to move it forward like it needs. I need funds for: sourcing & buying material paying manufacturer to sew it up packaging costs PR & marketing (although, having builder's love a product that
    solves builder's bum is pretty great PR!!) This is a garment that is helpful for not only the obvious like
  builder's and plumbers, but sports people like skiers and cyclists,
  mums and older women, pregnant ladies and people sitting down or
  bending over. There are SO many people that can benefit from Backuppz! Having some
  funds to go forward and make it happen is something I will be ever so
  thankful and appreciative for. Anyone who donates and wishes to be
  informed of when it's available, please visit my website to enter your
  contact details and waist and hip measurements. IMPORTANT NOTE: The reason I am not depicting the product fully
  online is because it's still in development. Backuppz Ltd. (company
  number: 09801582). Thank you in advance for your belief in Backuppz! Remember, when you need cover, call for Backuppz! Credit for ""Ban the bumb"" : Janet White",https://fundrazr.com/918793
190,You Can Help Agi's Quest to Help Hungary Thrive,,,,,,"Let me begin by saying thank you so much, I am deeply grateful for
  for all donations and every dollar contributed. I am sure by now
  you're wondering, help Hungary, WHY? I was first inspired to help Hungary when I was 18 years old after
  my mother took me to Europe when I graduated high school. I arrived in
  Hungary as a brat with an attitude, I returned to the USA a humble,
  young woman thankful to live in the land of the free. The first photo
  below is me and my brother Miki, with my mom. The second phot is my
  mom, as a young woman in Hungary. While I was in Hungary in 1974, it was still under communist reign. I
  was exposed to what life is like in a country where freedom is not the
  norm. I had not realize how privliedged I was to have to have simple
  things like a telephone in my room at home in the states. In Hungary,
  no one in our family had a phone in their home and two of my aunts did
  not even have refrigerators in their homes. What they did have was an
  abundance of love and such generosity that made my stay in Hungary
  amazing. Read on, I share the backstory of my parents escaping during
  the Hungarian Revolution. Fast foward to July 2013. Our family was headed to the Budapest
  airport, returning back home to the USA. As I gazed out my window at
  acres upon acres of sunflowers, I asked myself, “how can I help
  Hungary? How can I help my family?” It was then that a seed formulated
  with the idea to create opportunities revolving around sunflowers to
  help my family and help fellow Hungarians thrive. A Quest Propelled by Sunflowers Let me backtrack to the year 2012. Jay, my husband of 30 years passed
  away suddenly from a heart attack at 58 years old. Jay had been out of
  work for three years from the recession. He had finally found a great
  job and was just shy a month of receiving his benefits. We had no
  insurance and no savings. I was beyond sad and heartbroken. Life felt
  scary and so uncertain. Also, my heart was still heavy from the loss
  of my brother Jeff, who passed away very suddenly from a heart attack
  the year before. He was only 44 years old. My mother, my hero, decided we needed something to look forward to
  and began making plans for us to visit Hungary in 2013. The journey
  evolved with 24 of us from the USA flying to Hungary for a family
  reunion to celebrate my aunt’s 85th birthday. It was the last time I
  would see her, as she passed away in 2014. Ever since then, I have
  been driven with a burning desire to make my way back and help Hungary. Now I am on a quest propelled by love, family and sunflowers. I am
  making plans for 2016 to stay in Hungary for about a year. I will sell
  most of my wordly possessions  with the intention to help fund
  my journey to Hungary. I am eager to use my voice and my influence to promote the amazing
  folk artists and artisans who live in little villages who are not
  plugged into technology. With your help, I know I can inspire
  prosperity with the help of American ingenuity, without disrupting
  Hungary's rich, historic culture. I am happy to report, I am developing my company, Sunflower Ventures,
  LLC, to be a globally responsible company that is green conscious,
  honors Fair Trade standards and will make contributions to give back. The money contibuted will help: buy a commercial location used for vacation rentals; I have been a
    property management specialist for more than 10 years. co-op space for artists, embroiderers, photographers’ and artisans
    who make handcrafted goods. eCommerce site to promote and sell Hungarian goods worldwide. The goal is, and will forever remain, creating opportunities to help
  Hungarians thrive. The ideal space is  a commercial building similar
  to the one below that has upstairs living quarters for the vacation
  rentals and a shop below for the Sunflower Co-Op space. The vision for
  Sunflower Ventures, LLC includes; creating income
  opportunities for Hungarians. I plan to leverage video to promote the
  eCommerce website, along with tourism, for the many quaint Hungarian
  villages and historic locations. I am committed to alleviating the financial struggles of my family
  and native Hungarians. My desire is to encourage people to help
  themselves through the old adage, “give a man a fish, he eats for a
  day, teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime.” I want my efforts
  to be significant, make a contribution to the Hungarian economy and
  pay it forward to the land of my birth. Backstory of How I Arrived in the USA The back story began when I was an infant in 1956 and my parents
  escaped with me during the Hungarian
  Revolution. They walked nearly a hundred miles to escape
  living a life opressed by communism. My mother and father arrived in
  the United States with just me and the clothes on their backs.
  They had no jobs, no home, no family or friends, nor did they speak
  one word of English. Even with nothing to their names, my parents were fortunate to escape
  Hungary. However, our family left behind and many Hungarians in low
  lying areas, to this day, still suffer with a lack of jobs and
  struggle to make ends meet. This amazing country, rich with history and longtime traditions is
  still not economically stable. Hungarians lived under communist reign until
  1989 , which was only 27 years ago. When communism ended,
  there were no plans for economic growth and Hungary has made
  incremental progress ever since. In 2014, an OECD.org economy
  report stated, “Hungary has exited from recession in
  early 2013, but the recovery is modest. Growth potential is held back
  by weak investment, low employment among low-skilled workers and
  shortcomings in labor and product markets, making further structural
  reforms essential.” I realize there are many causes out there seeking financial
  assistance. I urge you to see the value of helping Hungarians thrive.
  Your contribution will truly make a difference. Let me wrap up by once again saying thank you so much. I am
  deeply grateful for every dollar contributed. No amount is too little
  – every bit helps and every contributor is part of the larger goal. If
  you cannot donate at this time, please help spread the word and
  share my quest to help Hungary thrive.",https://fundrazr.com/9152v2
"2,956",SOUNDBOKS: THE LOUDEST BATTERY-POWERED SPEAKER,U.S. Dollar,,of $8k goal,4,37%,"SOUNDBOKS
  is the ultimate speaker for outdoor parties, sports and any sort of
  festive get-together. Designed by industry-leading engineers and
  experienced party-goers, it delivers extreme volume, unbreakable
  design and maximum battery life. We’ve decided to bring SOUNDBOKS to
  the Fundrazr community first, and we invite you to be the first to
  help bring the SOUNDBOKS experience to life. We
  wanted the SOUNDBOKS to work for any occasion, so we tested the design
  to withstand any extreme situation you can dream of. Our vision is for
  you to be able to create the experience of a concert or a festival
  anywhere, anytime. The SOUNDBOKS features a lightweight, but ultra
  durable design that helps ensure that the SOUNDBOKS always delivers -
  whether you’re at a wild tailgate or an all-night party at the
    beach. Turn
  it UP, UP, UP - all the way to 11! The SOUNDBOKS combines high Sound
  Pressure Level (SPL) speaker units with our powerful SOUNDBOKS
  amplifier to blast sound levels of up to 119 decibels - louder than an
  average PA-system at a rock concert! Suffice to say, the SOUNDBOKS is
  street-party and rave ready. The
  SOUNDBOKS’ classic flight case design combines durable plywood with
  high-quality aluminum parts to ensure a rugged design. You’ll never
  have to worry about whether or not your SOUNDBOKS can handle its
  environment - it’s rain, splash, shock and snow proof, and just
  waiting for your next move. Ever
  tried to use a device only to find that the battery has died? Let’s be
  honest - it sucks. With the SOUNDBOKS, you’ll never have to stop
  partying. Our batteries are proven to provide 30 hours of sound in a
  single charge. Each SOUNDBOKS purchase comes with two batteries that
  are external and swappable. We've chosen a unique chemistry, named
  LiFePO4, that can deliver under any circumstances - from the freezing
  winters to the burning summers. And with a charging time of only 3
  hours, you’ll never have to stop playing. There’s
  a genius behind every industry-disrupting product, and the same goes
  for the SOUNDBOKS. Johnny Engberg is renowned in the online
  open-source audio community as “Saturnus,” and is responsible for our
  unique acoustics and amplifier. The SOUNDBOKS is the accumulation of
  15 years of Johnny’s research, and utilizes a range of his brilliant
  design techniques. Johnny has worked collectively with Dutch amplifier
  specialist, Accusafe, responsible for developing some of the world’s
  most efficient amplifiers and highest-quality bluetooth modules. Don’t
  take our word for it! Here’s what the experts are saying: The
  SOUNDBOKS is a wicked product on its own, but we’ve taken it one step
  further. We’ve developed a set of awesome accessories to enhance the
  experience for you. To add them to your SOUNDBOKS pledge, simply add
  the $ amount specified next to the accessory, and we'll add it to your
  order. I.e. if you want the SOUNDBOKS reward for $499 and the
  SOUNDTRUCK for $79, you pledge $578. We'll contact you after the
  campaigns end, to coordinate your accessories. SOUNDTRUCK
  - The SOUNDBOKS is surprisingly light, but there may be times when
  you’re traveling far, or want to easily carry an extra case of beer.
  That’s why we’ve made our own unique, click-on trolley system: the
  SOUNDTRUCK. Fit your speaker on in seconds when you’re on-the-go, and
  click-off when you’ve found your sweet spot. MOBILEBOKS
  - What good is a speaker that lasts 30 hours if your phone dies after
  3? Charge your phone up to 6 times on a single charge with our own
  high-quality MOBILEBOKS: a portable powerbank with a sleek aluminum
  design, that's built to last, just like the SOUNDBOKS. VOICEBOKS
  - The world’s loudest battery-driven speaker only gets better when you
  add an awesome microphone - the VOICEBOKS. Connect the VOICEBOKS to
  your speaker in a flash, and you’re ready to cheer on your favorite
  sports team or bust out those karaoke skills you’ve been hiding. At SOUNDBOKS, we believe product development is an art. We have a
  strong team, that is focused on creating projects in the intersection
  between pioneering technology, and awesome user experiences. The
  SOUNDBOKS has went through many iterations, until we finalized it. Another thing, that we treat with the utmost seriousness at SOUNDBOKS
  is manufacturing. We've screened several different production
  partners, visited all of our subcontractors, and ended up with a set
  of suppliers and partners, that we KNOW can deliver as promised. For
  our assembly, we've teamed up with Flextronics, a global EMS company
  who is known for manufacturing for companies such as Apple, Microsoft
  and Ford. We're creating the first batches of SOUNDBOKS in Sweden, so
  our Danish team can visit often and audit the production. Christoffer, Jesper and Hjalte met in high school, and immediately
  bonded over their love of wicked sound and the parties it made
  possible. Driven by a passion for speaker design and great experience,
  the boys created SOUNDBOKS. Over the last several years, the team has
  built a range of outdoor sound systems, and has been featured in
  magazines such as VICE and EUROMAN. The founding team brought an
  all-new dimension to the product by teaming-up with sound technician
  extraordinaire, Johnny Engberg. In the past year, the team has grown to more than 15 full-time
  employees, who all individually contribute to the SOUNDBOKS culture.
  Though the core team is still young, they’ve brought hardcore
  experience in the fields of design, production and logistics to ensure
  that they deliver on their promises to our customers. SOUNDBOKS’
  cooperation with Flextronics is handled by Global Logistics Manager,
  Thor Mønsted, who brings decades of experience managing his own
  production firms, and handling logistics on a grand scale. SOUNDBOKS combines industry experience with unique, innovative
  design, and has created the highest level of technology and
  performance to bring you the perfect speaker. At
  SOUNDBOKS, we believe in the hustle. With our first version, we went
  from finished product to shipping real products within just a few
  months - and we didn’t stop there. The last 8 months have been spent
  gathering feedback and improving our product until we reached full
  satisfaction. Now, the SOUNDBOKS is finished, and we’re ready to bring
  it to you… Thank
  you for reading all the way to the end. We hope that you’re just as
  excited about the SOUNDBOKS as we are, and that you’ll join us in
  throwing better (and louder) parties all around the world. We’re crazy
  about what we’ve made, and we’re honored to share it with the Fundrazr
  community.",https://fundrazr.com/916gc7

  de mon parcours, j'ai besoin d'acheter de meilleurs outils
  (perceuse-fraiseuse, moteur plus puissant pour ma ponceuse
  stationnaire fabriquée par moi-même...) pour continuer à progresser
  dans mon art et mon artisanat. Pour lever les fonds nécessaires à
  cette évolution, je mets donc en place une pré-vente : achetez votre
  lame à -25%, profitez d'une exclusivité exceptionnelle (manches fait
  des dernières pièces de mon stock de bois de teck équitable de la
  forêt de Thaïlande), et aidez moi à surpassez mes limites... In a few words : I'm Ben, and I'm a handcrafter
  knifemaker. At this point on my way, I need to buy better tools
  (drilling/milling machine, more powerful motor for my homemade
  stationnary grinder...) to keep improving my art and my handcraft. So
  to raise the necessary funds, I'm organising a pre-sale campaign where
  you can order your blade with a 25% discount, enjoy an amazing
  exclusivity (handle made of the last pieces of my stock of sustainable
  teak wood from the Thai forest) and help me to go beyond my limits... . TOUTE L'HISTOIRE : Je m'appelle Ben. J'ai 29
  ans et cela fait maintenant trois ans et demi que je vis en Thaïlande,
  à Chiang Mai. J'ai commencé à fabriquer des couteaux il y a environ un
  an, inspiré par mes arrière-arrière-grand-père et arrière-grand-père
  qui ont travaillé dans la coutellerie depuis 1865 . Depuis le début, mes couteaux ont rencontré un grand
  succès et les commandes se sont succédées, m'inspirant et me donnant
  le courage de tout apprendre par moi-même, du travail du métal jusqu'à
  la fabrication des mécanismes de précision pour le verrouillage des
  lames des couteaux pliants. Mais maintenant, à ce point de mon aventures,
  arrivent deux moments charnières : mon retour en France pour
  m'installer dans une maison à la campagne où je vais mettre en place
  un bel atelier, et le stade de ma progression où je me retrouve limité
  par mes outils pour continuer à améliorer la qualité de mon travail. C'est pourquoi j'ai besoin de nouveaux et meilleurs
    outils, pour repousser mes limites et améliorer la finition de mes créations. Donc , plutôt que de m'endetter auprès d'une banque
    afin d'acheter une perceuse-fraiseuse à 1700€ ( http://www.btpmat.fr/perceuse-fraiseuse-sans-socle-230v-16mm-fx-820v-promac.html )
    , un moteur plus puissant pour ma ponceuse stationnaire faite maison
    (400€) , et si possible une scie à bande (350€ pour les machines
    premiers prix) ainsi que les accessoires et consommables allant avec
    (+/- 1000€) , j'ai décidé de faire un pari bien plus osé : organiser
    cet évènement, et prendre des pré-commandes qui me permettront de
    subvenir, grâce à vous, aux besoins d'investissements auxquels je
    fais face tout en exerçant mon métier et ma passion, tout en
    produisant des créations qui feront votre plaisir. Et comme je considère que l'aide doit aller dans les deux sens pour
  être valable, de mon côté, je vous offre une réduction de 25%
    par rapport au prix public ainsi que le privilège
    d'avoir vos lames montées de manches en bois rare, équitable, et à
    l'histoire unique : une grosse branche de teck sauvage
  coupée il y a des années, sans doute par les gardes du parc national
  derrière ma maison en Thaïlande, que j'ai trouvé et ramené en la
  tirant à la force des bras jusqu'à chez moi. Mon stock est extrêmement
  limité, et il est à l'heure actuelle impossible de trouver légalement
  du teck de Thaïlande de cette qualité, a fortiori avec la garantie que
  la forêt n'a pas été détruite pour produire ce bois (le teck de ce
  genre vient maintenant de Birmanie, sans aucune garantie de respect de
  l'environnement). Vous pouvez voir ci-dessous un exemple d'une de
  mes machette équipée d'un manche de ce bois. Les dessins toujours
  différents se révèlent avec les courbes et la sculpture de la poignée. THE WHOLE STORY: I'm Ben, I'm 29 years old, and I have been living in Northern
  Thailand for three and a half years. I started to make knives about
  one year ago, inspired by my great-great-grand-father and my
  great-grand-father, who have been working in knives making since 1865 From the beginning, my knives encountered a great success and orders
  have been coming in one after the others, giving me courage and
  inspiration to learn everything by myself, from metal work technics to
  making the precision mecchanism for the blade locking systems on
  folding knives. But at this point of my adventure, I face a double turning point : I will come back in France very soon, to go to live in a
  countryside house where I want to set up a nice workshop; and I arrive
  at the moment in my work evolution where I find myself limited by my
  tool and can't improve more my work. That's why I need to buy better, more precise tools. And,
    instead of getting a loan from a bank to purchase a drilling-milling
    machine (1700€ - http://www.btpmat.fr/perceuse-fraiseuse-sans-socle-230v-16mm-fx-820v-promac.html ) a more powerfull motor for my homemade belt grinder (400€) and if
    possible a bandsaw (the cheapest are 350€), as well as the
    accessories and diposables like grinding belts etc (total +/-
    1000€), I decided to make a much nicer and bald bet
    : organise this pre-sale event and book in pre-orders that will
    allows me to face all those investments needs, while doing my job
    and passion and offering you great creations. And as i consider that this kind of help must go in
  both directions, I offer you a 25% discount on the retails
  price as well as an exclusive privilege : the handles
    of the orders will be made of rare, exotic, sustainable wood with a
    unique story. I found in the forest behind my house this
  big branch of wild teak wood cut years ago, most
  likely by the National Park's rangers. I dragged it back by hand to my
  house then, and this wood happened to be of the highest quality. My
  stock are, though, very limited and it's currently impossible to find
  such wood, of this quality, with the certitude thatthe forest hasn't
  been destroyed to get it. The only way to find asian wild teak wood is
  to get it from Myanmar, but without any garantee that the logging has
  been done through environmentally respectful process. Most probably not... You can see below a picture of one of my machetes equipped with teak
  wood handle. The amazing randoms patterns reveals while grinding down
  the curves of the handles.",https://fundrazr.com/115tI7

  spacing inside for trays, lugs or totes. Walla Walla is a place of craftspeople, and it didn't take long to
  put my ideas into design form.  Dave of Hard Rock Machine Works looks
  like you'd expect Dave of Hard Rock Machine Works to look; like a guy
  who can build stuff. When I first entered his shop, Dave wouldn't talk to me for a minute
  because he needed to meticulously focus on grinding a shaft down to
  size so that it would have the right weight.  As soon as we sat down
  to discuss my idea, I knew I was in the right place.  At the end of
  our meeting, Dave offered to make the whole cart, wheels and all. So why the ask?  I see this investment as an opportunity for those
  who don't get to enjoy the labors of the farm to participate in my
  labors.  This cart will move a quarter yard of compost, haul exactly
  twenty four flats, nine lugs or three totes.  It is an investment in
  both the craft of intentional design and the craft of my farm. A cart isn't just a piece of equipment either.  It is THE
    piece of equipment.  I would not consider crowd funding for any
    other tool, because nothing quite speaks to lightening the load like
    a cart.  It lets one person do the job of many people. Please consider making a contribution RIGHT NOW .  We
  have one week to raise our money, so if you are going to donate, get
  your wallet and click the ""Contribute"" button before you

"1,108",Please help us provide greener power to our world,U.S. Dollar,,of $27k goal,5,4%,"The Renewable Energy Anywhere Project was
  launched informally during a discussion a few years ago that one of
  the project founders, Lonnie Ross, had with other people who were
  concerned about our environment: The need to significantly reduce pollution, the difficulty of
    creating an infrastructure to provide ""clean""
    ""green"" renewable energy to replace or significantly
    reduce the use of depleting limited fossil fuels like oil, and
    coming up with a solution that everyone around the world could buy into. Lonnie, Twanna Brunson and others asked questions,did research, and
  got involved,forming a project team. We started this project to help make renewable energy available
  anywhere, so that electrical power can be produced by using
  clean-green-renewable energy sources on the spot, on demand. As far back as 2001, we were intrigued by the use of fuel cells as a
  renewable ""clean"" energy power source that could replace the
  use of fossil fuels over a period of time. We saw the need for a fuel
  cell system that was affordable, ready for commercialization and could
  be as easily refueled as energy systems that required gasoline. Here's the problem: We
  need power to fuel our world and our stuff. But we are polluting our
  world with the production and use of fossil fuels. We haven’t been
  able to capture wind, sun and other renewable clean energy sources in
  ways sufficient enough to significantly reduce and eventually
  eliminate our dependence and use of unclean fuels like coal, oil, and
  gasoline to power our appliances, our homes, our businesses, our
  communities and our vehicles. People use batteries that have to be recharged regularly, gasoline
  that is produced from fossil fuels that pollutes the air and will
  eventually be depleted, and an electric grid that continues to fall
  short of ever increasing power demand, especially during
  ""peak"" demand. Our Renewable Energy Anywhere Project addresses this problem: Our patent-pending energy system is designed to use components of
  existing and proven technology, connected and combined in efficient
  ways that allows the system to generate power and refuel on demand. No
  known fuel cell system does this. Technically: At the center of our project is a unique
  ""clean"" energy device whose components are connected in a
  closed system that produces electricity from a fuel cell fueled by
  hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources and efficient routing
  and rerouting of power, heat, and water generated within the system on demand. Currently, companies and organizations like Walmart,
  Microsoft, Google, large corporations, the government, the military,
  and more are investing in and purchasing fuel cells/fuel cell systems
  to power various applications from forklift trucks to golf carts to
  homes to buildings and corporate campuses. Our Renewable Energy Anywhere Project is in the next step of building
  the prototype of the complete energy system that produces its own fuel
  by capturing renewable energy that powers the fuel cell that produces
  the required electricity for any appliance: a car, a truck, a bus, all
  the appliances in a home, the power for buildings, even neighborhoods.
  Anywhere at anytime on demand. And it’s all green and clean. Don’t have to worry about getting the fuel to the fuel cell system.
  It’s being produced on the spot, on demand within the system. We’ve recently finished the latest, patent-pending design, the Ross
  Self Contained Energy System. And we are in the next step of our
  project where we are now working on the prototype, and with your help,
  we hope to have completed by the end of this year! We need your help. Help us to make the Ross Self Contained Energy
  System a reality. What Will This Money Go Towards? Cost of prototype components and labor Building/assembling the prototype Testing the prototype Project administration and promoting our proof Please give financially today to the Renewable Energy Anywhere
  Project. And share with and tell your friends to get behind this
  project by passing the word on and donating to our project. Your donations will help get this project, this innovation off the
  ground with a completed, proven and tested prototype. We can have this
  stage of this project completed before Christmas: the Ross renewable
  energy electric power generator for anywhere! Our goal is to prove that we have the solution by building
    this prototype this year that will eventually lead to the mass
    production of this clean energy system that we can make available
    with the support of eco-conscious and green advocates everywhere. We are just a few steps closer to completion. We are raising money
  for the components, labor, assembly and testing of the project product. Thank you for financially supporting our cause and joining our
  movement to make a cleaner world using clean energy available to
  everyone, everywhere. Pick a perk and help to make positive change for
  our world and for the users of energy. Together, we can do this. For our future. For our children. For right now. Thank you again, The Renewable Energy Anywhere Project Team Meet two members of the project team This project is the result of collaborations, research,
    interviews and technological developments over the past 15 years
    that have included engineers, scientists, academics and
    environmentally concerned people. This project has brought together
    some of the most innovative concepts and develpments, with advice
    and feedback from a variety of people in an interdisciplinary
    approach to help reach the goal of this project. Two have been more
    hands on with the project over all others: Project Advisor, Marketer Twanna Brunson is a project advisor and marketer. Because of her
  shared concerns about global warming, pollution, dependence on foreign
  fuels, fluctuations in gas prices, depleting resources, as well as,
  her love for business and entreprenurism, she got involved with the
  development of this project. Twanna believes in the use of renewable
  energy sources to improve and eventually dominate our energy
  infrastructure. Professionally she has a background as an insurance
  specialist.  She has an Associates in Applied Science in Electronic
  Engineering Technology, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Legal Studies. Primary System Designer, Product Manager Lonnie
  Ross is the project primary system designer. He designed the self
  contained energy system that is at the heart of the project. He
  received a provisonal patent recently for the system design. Lonnie
  has spent the past 15 years researching, collaborating and developing
  clean ""green"" technology as well as related innovations and
  developements. A college graduate, Lonnie also has a backgound in
  accounting, marketing and business planning. Support and Join the project! Supporting the project is as easy as contributing
  whatever amount of money to the project from $25.00 to $100.00 to
  $250.00 to $1,000.00 to $5,000.00 or as much or as little as you are
  able to. And, then tell family and friends, so that they can do the same. Joining is simple!  Make a financial contribution to help us reach
  our goal of sucessfully building the prototype for the project. You can also join us by selecting a perk from the choices on the
  right hand side. This entitles you to additional benefits for
  providing that level of support. If you are interested in additional involvement in the project as a
  contribution of your time and skills during the current building and
  testing stage (you are a student or chemist or engineer or scientist
  or just interested in helping us reach our goal) please contact us so
  that we can discuss this with you. We like the idea of this being a
  community project.",https://fundrazr.com/renewableenergyanywhere

"1,541",Help our Dream of Legacy Coffee Company come true!,U.S. Dollar,,of $25k goal,36,6%,"Don’t you think there is something comforting in the aroma of a
  freshly brewed cup of coffee? It conjures up feelings of warmth and
  security as it boosts you forward into your day! Sometimes, it might
  even be the only thing telling you “ you’ve got this!” when faced with
  mandatory overtime, or that crammed study session! Whether we notice
  or not, great things happen over a good cup of coffee! Friendships are
  made, dreams are created, and in the case of my wife and I, love is
  found! Coffee and coffee shops in particular have a wonderful romance
  to them! They have the ability to bridge generations, connect cultures
  and unite strangers together! So, what creates this “magic”? Is it the coffee? Is it the people
  serving it? Is it the coffee shop itself? We think it is all of the
  above! We love coffee! And we love people! So we put the two together
  and created the plan for LEGACY COFFEE COMPANY. We are Joshua and Kara Merrill. We are coffee people. And we want
  to use our love of coffee to serve a much greater cause! Our story: We have always wanted to own a coffee shop! Even before we knew
  each other, Kara and I always had a desire to have a cafe that rocked
  freshly roasted espresso, and had a vibe that people would love to
  hang out at! So, April of 2015 we decided to take our dream off the “
  shelf” and give it legs. We wrote it down! It took us several hundred
  hours of planning, researching, reading books, watching videos and
  meeting with those who had been down the road of starting a business
  before we had what we felt like was a good plan. So, with a business
  plan in place, we then started developing new relationships with LOCAL
  providers. IT WAS AND IS A HUGE PART OF WHO WE ARE TO SUPPORT AS MUCH
  OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMY AS WE CAN! So when we found excellent, locally
  roasted coffee, an excellent local baker and a local dairy, we were
  thrilled! We had the makings of a GREAT coffee shop! But, we wanted to
  GIVE more! We realized there was a NEED in our own community that WE
  COULD HELP WITH! We sought out several non profits groups who were passionately
  pouring out into the growing city that we love! The ones who were clothing the homeless, feeding
  the hungry and restoring the lives of those suffering from substance
  abuse stood out loud and clear! We want to stand with them as we
  nurture and celebrate life together, through coffee! WHAT IS THE MONEY FOR? We need $30,000 for the entire project. We are contributing $5,000 of
  our own and asking for $25,000 for the remaining expenses. $25,000 broken down: Deposit on building $ 7,400 (first and last months rent plus deposit) Build out on building $ 9,000 (plumbing, electric, building bar, etc.) Equipment $6,000 ( espresso machine, grinders, fridges etc.) Products and supplies $ 2,000 ( coffee beans, milk, pastries, etc.) Miscellaneous goods $600",https://fundrazr.com/legacycoffeeco
"1,030",Retail Outlet and New Products for Bliss Foods,Canadian Dollar,,of $7.8k goal,14,13%,"Update to our campaign June 27: S ince starting our campaign
      here a few weeks ago, a new opportunity has opened up that we'd
      like to share with you. Soon our products are going to be available for sale right from
      our kitchen location! We are very excited to be adding this retail opportunity where
      we produce and will keep you updated as this unfolds. The kitchen
      owner where we are currently sharing space with is looking for a
      new location to open a coffeeshop and Bliss products will not only
      be made there, but with an expanded product line. We will be offering other snacks, breads, treats, raw dried
      crackers, baking mixes and much more. On July 1 our campaign will go into extended time, so we are
        eager to spread the word this week. Only 4 more days! We really would appreciate your help in
        sharing this link, news about our great incentives (we're in the
        process of adding new ones too), and what we are up to! The Lively Lentil Cookie has been well received. This past
        month three of our retailers have now added this new product
        with more coming shortly! Team Bliss thanks you for your support! Bliss Specialty Foods (London, ON, Canada) handcrafts
  delicious, nutritious treats from whole food ingredients. We have been
  selling 2 products through local independent retailers for
  approximately 2 years. We are about more than just good taste! Our products are made without gluten, dairy, soy, grains, yeast, starch or refined
  sugars , yet are tasty enough, even those who do not
  ""have"" to avoid gluten or other specific ingredients are
  loving them. Currently we sell through approximately 20 retailers and within the
  next 6 months plan to expand our distribution to another 20 throughout
  Southwestern Ontario. Recently we have secured a new gluten free shared commercial kitchen
  and we are looking forward to utilizing this new space to grow to the
  next level. Since we have been bootstrapping it for these early years we are
  looking to generate some funds and additional resources to help us
  scale up our production. Ready to launch our new third product, The Lively Lentil Cookie! These first few years, we have been renting space from other
  businesses and and although we would someday like to have our own
  commercial kitchen, the sharing of space helps keep everyone's fixed
  overhead costs down. Our products can be delivered right to your door by ordering them
  through this campaign.  We are also about to launch an online platform
  for our products so that after this campaign is over you will still be
  able to order stretching from Windsor to Ottawa for a flat rate
  shipping fee of $7.50. Bliss Specialty Foods Products 1) The Honey Almond Brunch Bar Our best selling product. Packed with pumpkin and sunflower seeds, coconut, ground almonds,
  real vanilla and plenty of organic coconut oil, this healthier treat
  satisfies even the most discerning taste. Containing 4g of
  coconut oil in each 26g snack along with 10 ground almonds, this is a
  decadent snack, loaded with nutrition! Many people have told us they
  make a great lunch when on the go and you are looking for a quick, yet
  sustaining, light meal. Available in both Chocolate and Original flavours on a regular basis,
  in 2 and 4 packs. Rotating Seasonal Flavours A rotating feature flavour is often available as well, such as:
  Blueberry, Pumpkin Pie Spice, Matcha Green Tea with fresh Kale,
  Cranberry or Licorice Root, Goji Berry and other superfoods. 2) The Coconut Macaroon Made with organic coconut oil, sulphite-free shredded coconut,
  almonds, real vanilla and a dash of Himalayan pink salt. It's low
  temperature baked and available in both Dark Chocolate and Vanilla.The
  Vegan version (pictured below), is made with organic coconut nectar.
   We also offer the same Macaroon made with raw honey. About Our Ingredients Some of our favourite ingredients are: almond flour; organic, virgin
  coconut oil; sunflower and pumpkin seeds; coconut nectar; local honey;
  coconut; fair trade, dairy free dark chocolate. Our newest product—the
  Lively Lentil Cookie—will be a nut free treat and Vegan (except for
  the honey used). We do NOT use : grains dairy/casein soy & corn gums (xanthum or guar) eggs refined sugar yeast trans fats preservatives ""natural flavours"" GMOs You will not find xanthum gum in our products, as it is a highly
  processed, usually GM (genetically modified) and derived from corn. It
  can be quite an irritant to the GI tract and yet most gluten free
  baked goods contain it. We soak our pumpkin and sunflower seeds in re-mineralized distilled
  water before they are slow roasted and ready for the recipe. While
  this is an extra step, it helps break down the seeds so they are
  easier to digest, (along with giving them and extra light crunch). We purchase local ingredients when possible and Direct/Fair Trade
  when not. Our newest product is possible to make using all locally
  sourced ingredients from this area of Canada! Since we are passionate about making treats with healthy ingredients,
  we do not use additives, chemicals or preservatives that are commonly
  found in many foods today and almost all of our ingredients are
  certified organic. (Or we know the farmer). Many gluten free treats contain fillers, gums and refined sugars, but
  you will not find any in our products. We do not follow one diet, but our products lean towards the SCD
  (Specific Carb Diet). Expansion Time Not only are we launching a new product, we are also expanding our
  distribution further into S/W Ontario. Our products can now be shipped
  to you from Windsor to Ottawa, overnight delivery.  Watch for new
  retailers coming shortly extending from Windsor to Toronto. To help us expand we have recently moved in to a new shared
  commercial kitchen. New Wholesale Product The Lively Lentil Cookie We are ready to start wholesaling a third product: The Lively
    Lentil Cookie ! It is being offered here for sale for the
  first time. Made with all organic ingredients, this unique treat is not only a
  tasty, soft cookie, but is loaded with protein, containing 4.4 g of
  protein and 196 calories in each 50g cookie. Made with a red lentil, blonde flax and chick pea flour base, this
  cookie is a satisfying snack. We add cranberries, sunflower seeds, raw
  honey and currants along with a touch of apple cider vinegar,
  Himalayan salt and baking soda. It has been a wish of our to sell a treat made with all local
  ingredients! Except for the coconut oil, Himalayan salt, and
  chocolate, this cookie can be made with all Canadian ingredients! Available in both Original and Dark Chocolate Chip (dairy free, Fair
  Trade chocolate). How Bliss Got Started Beginning with only a few thousand dollars in 2012, we bought a tent,
  ingredients, rented a commercial kitchen part-time, registered and
  licensed the business, then got to work testing out recipes at local
  farmer's markets and events. In 2014, Bliss started wholesaling the Honey Almond
  Brunch Bar and the Coconut Macaroon through local independent health
  food stores, coffee shops and bakeries. Our Honey Almond Brunch Bar can now be found at over 20
  different locations throughout Southwestern Ontario. Proud to be retailing through local independant businesses: (a partial list of our retailers include- for a more detailed look
  visit our blog or website) Angelos Bakery Locomotive Espresso Café The Root Cellar Restaurant Quarter Master Natural Food Store Ontario Hall and Saugeen Hall at Western University Nooners Cafe The Little Red Roaster Cafe (Covent Garden Market) On The Move Organics delivery service Gentle Rain Natural Foods in Stratford Purdy Natural For an up to date list of our retail partners please refer to our website or blog. Supporting Local We are making plans to help support our local communities and will
  keep you posted in updates on what we are up to. This is listed below
  in our goals and Mission Statement. It is our desire to work with local farmers and be able to grow our
  ingredients in the near future. Talks are in progress and we will
  announce news as it unfolds. Supporting local independent retailers is also very
  important to us. We prefer to sell either direct to the customer or through local
  independant businesses. If you would like to see us in a store
  near you, please ask the manager to carry Bliss products, and send us
  an email! We offer in store samplings where we get a chance to meet our
  customers face to face and share with them what our products are about. Our Mission 1) To produce fine quality products made from organic, whole, real
  foods without grains, dairy, soy, corn, refined sugars, GMOs or preservatives. 2) To support local independent retailers. 3) To advocate for a clean, safe, food supply. 4) To contribute back to our local community by working with
  initiatives and community organizations. Goals for Bliss 1) To expand our distribution to 40 retailers within the next
    6 months reaching from Windsor to Toronto. 2) To launch online retail sales in June 2016 delivering to
    Southwestern Ontario (Windsor to Ottawa) through Canada Post
    overnight delivery. 3) To donate some of our product to local food initiatives and
    support other community groups. 4) To become part of the NON-GMO project and to possibly get
    certified organic and gluten free. 5) To hire a couple of team members that could help Bliss expand. Long Term Goals To write blog posts including recipes and information about living
  the grain free lifestyle. In the next few years to be able to grow our own sunflower seeds
  locally along with other ingredients through local sustainable farms. Securing our own kitchen space in the months/years to come. At that
  time our kitchen too will be open to other small food production businesses. To help facilitate a cooperative retail space where local sustainable
  businesses passionate about selling quality products can sell from. We Take Food Seriously Many local customers know that we take cross contamination seriously;
  however, as we expand outside of our local neighbourhood, becoming
  certified gluten free is important. We eat this way at home for health
  reasons and understand what it is like trying to find healthy food
  products free of ingredients we don't eat. The four founding members of Bliss have over 40 combined
  years’ experience in the service industry and we are enthusiastic
  about providing healthy and delicious food. Shari Blanchard, the founder and owner of Bliss has over two
  decades of experience operating a food service business. Raising
  children with multiple food sensitivities instilled a drive and
  passion to provide tasty yet healthy treats. We are a family run business and now have one new part time staff
  member along with a few dear friends that support us as needed. Within the next few month we expect to be hiring 1 or 2 more part
  time team members to help with everything from food production to
  deliveries, events and more. There have been many people who have helped Bliss come this
  far. Friends, family and customers have provided invaluable assistance
  in so many ways. We are in gratitude for their support! The owner’s children, now adults, both have been instrumental in the
  growing of this business. Jason helped the business launch at the
  market in 2012 and continues as his health allows. When we were
  attending markets, Alexis helped with sales and setup. She is also our
  graphic designer, which includes the responsibilities of designing our
  labels and other signage while attending university full time. We have grown this business on a shoe string budget using the boot
  strap business model method. The business made a modest profit right
  from the start but it is now time to take this to the next level. A
  couple of years of sweat equity and investing all we had has helped us
  build a solid foundation and brand recognition around our city and region. Our Incentives/Perks Organic cotton/hemp t-shirts dyed naturally with local blueberries
  and other natural dyes. Aprons (locally sewn with organic cotton/hemp) for creating your own
  bliss in the kitchen. Products ranging from cases of Brunch Bars, our new Lively Lentil
  Cookie and even a chance to be on the Official Bliss Taste Testing
  Team for the next couple of years. Check out our incentives to the right ===> For everyone who shares our campaign your name will be entered in our
  draw to win either a case of Bliss Honey Almond Brunch Bars (4pk: 6
  choc + 6 Original) or 8 Lively Lentil Cookies. Delivery included
  anywhere in Canada or the USA. Budget $2000 - 3000 Ingredients $3000  Labels, packaging, signage, upgrade website, laptop &
  laser printer repairs $500 - 700 Food processor, baking pans, small wares. Our ongoing sales will be able to provide for some of the costs of
  our expansion so we have set our crowdfunding goal for $7770. (We like
  it when the numbers line up). Generating more capital it will allow us to expand our distribution
  even more quickly throughtout S/W Ontario and beyond. Possibly even
  helping us along towards buying a ""Bliss Delivery Van"". It is our hope to be able to offer distribution to our retailers
  throughout S/W Ontario on a bi-weekly basis and to team up with a few
  other London based production compainies that would like to join
  distribution forces. Please contact us if you are interested in distributing your hand
  made products ranging from gf/dairy free baked goods, CPGs, soaps,
  creams and other items to other businesses we are retailing with. Investment Opportunity We are at the stage of growth that we are looking for investors who
  are interested in helping Bliss grow and scale. Whether it be
  through a loan or by selling a percentage of our business, we are
  willing to sell up to 20% of the business to an investor who
  understands why we are producing the type of products we are. Our 5-10
  year plan is to scale Bliss into a sizeable business and we feel we
  have created a strong foundation to support this. Thank you for reading our campaign. Please share this around. Wishing you vibrant health and a bliss-filled day!",https://fundrazr.com/blissisexpanding
"6,020",Help #YEG bikes sing a fine tune with TC!,Canadian Dollar,,of $8k goal,53,75%,"Troubadour Cycles is Brahm Ollivierre. Born & raised in Edmonton, Alberta, I have been tinkering
    with bicycles for most of my life & have been working as a
    professional bicycle mechanic for the better part of the last
    decade.  In 2012, I travelled to Portland, Oregon where I attended
    the United Bicycle Institute (UBI) & became a Certified Bicycle
    Mechanic and DT Swiss Wheel Builder.  Shortly after returning from
    UBI, I decided to start up my own bike repair service called
    Troubadour Cycles. Today, Troubadour Cycles is a successful independent mobile
    bicycle repair service that uses a basic SUV with a 4-bike hitch
    rack to pick up bikes for repairs. As business has increased, the
    limitations of our setup have become more apparent (limited capacity
    for parts & tools, bikes exposed to weather & potential
    collision damage on an external rack). With a vehicle upgrade,
    Troubadour Cycles can securely pick up more bikes
    simultaneously, carry increased parts selection, & provide more
    effective doorstep repairs, thereby reducing repair turn around
    times. In the fall of 2015, we were excited to launch our line of
    hand-crafted bicycle accessories at The Royal Bison Craft and Art
    Fair. Our vision is to make functional accessories that add unique
    style and beauty to any bike. We make wooden fenders, crates,
    cycling caps and cloth bar-tape custom suited to each bike and
    rider. To continue creating these unique products and meet the
    customer demands, TC needs a workshop remodel, along with tool and
    website upgrades. Please join Troubadour Cycles as we embark on a new phase
      that can benefit all who bike in our beautiful river city. In joining our campaign you will contribute towards: An upgraded mobile repair vehicle with parts & tool

"2,070",Give Jailbreaking the Goddess Wings!,U.S. Dollar,,of $3.5k goal,24,60%,"I'm Lasara Firefox Allen. I'm an author, teacher, coach, and
  activist. As many of you already know, the past year and some months
  has been devoted to getting my latest book, Jailbreaking the
    Goddess: A Radical Revisioning of Feminist Spirituality into,
  well, BOOK form! You have been with me for the low moments and high, the deadlines
  pushed, met and exceeded. The all-nighters in the crappy motel. The
  hypomania-tinged rants. You know some of the context and terrain of
  this book. You responded to the questions about the five names, you helped me
  learn IPA and respeller techniques for pronunciation. You read
  chapters and gave me feedback. You checked me when I needed checking.
  You made yourself seen so that I could do my best to represent you. Jailbreaking is, in a real way, a product of OUR COMMUNITY,
    even though it came through me. I am forever grateful to each of you. In bringing the book to production, my editor, Elysia, and the team
  at Llewellyn have been amazing. Elysia pushed me (in the best possible
  ways) to deliver what is a much more radical book than even I had expected. And Laura, my final copy editor, knew what was up and
  went to bat for the book in order to keep important capitalization
  (and non) in place. I have copies in hand and the book has exceeded my
  expectations.The cover art makes my heart soar - it is glossy and
  refined, but still has relevant grit and urgency. And honestly, the
  smooth and luxurious handfeel makes me tingle all over.  I feel so supported! Already the book is being so well recieved. We
  are over a month out from the pub date and nearly a thousand copies
  have already sold. Jailbreaking has already hit a besteller
  list on Amazon, has met rave reviews, and has touched hearts and lives already. Starhawk, author of the classic Spiral Dance and The Fifth Sacred Thing among other titles, and founding
    member of Reclaiming Collective, has this to say about Jailbreaking: "" Jailbreaking the Goddess: A Radical Revisioning of Feminist Spirituality is an important contribution to the writings on Goddess tradition
    and feminist spirituality. Allen brings the tradition firmly into
    the twenty-first century. I love her political savvy, her
    sensitivity around issues of diversity and cultural awareness and
    appropriation, and her unabashed celebration of pleasure,
    sensuality, and life! "" Hers is one of many amazing, powerful voices that has risen in
  support of this book. I am deeply honored. Unfortunately, as we book lovers know, amazing words from respected
  writers is not enough to get books into hands and in front of eyes. We
  need promotion galore! We need reviews in fancy magazines, we need
  interviews on tv shows, we need impressive launch parties, we need
  swag, we need a strong platform and a good team. Yes. A team. I am
  admitting that I am 1. not the absolute best person for the PR job,
  and 2. I'm overwhelmed. I need help. I have some amazing team members ready to step up to the plate. My Initial Goal $500 will go to a PR team I'm ready to hire some social justice warriors who also are
  superstar PR people to do the jobs that I am not so good at. (Added
  benefit: because these awesome folks do this work all the time they
  also have an impressive contact list - one that I do not posses.) $500 will go to my web person I'm going to pay another community member to make my website
  work better and look nicer. Because that shizz matters. This person
  will also be making Jailbreaking info ultra accessible for me. It will
  be lovely. And this job os SO not my genius. $250 is for my coach. My initial goal is $1250. We can reach it. You know why? Because here's the deal: I'm not asking you to give me
    something for nothing. Far from it. I want this to be an
  ideal win/win situation. To that end I'm offering loaded value
    for each premium. You will be getting MORE bang for your
  buck when you order here than when you order off my site. Whether your
  donation level allows you to participate in an online course, or get a
  copy of Jailbreaking, or come to the launch party, you will be
    getting MORE THAN your donation's worth. My Secondary Goal: Should funding go over my first amount and
  I make it to my SECOND, unofficial goal, additional monies will go to this: $200 will go to buying some basic video equipment ...so I can make better videos! (I know:
  the one for this fundrazr is pretty...basic!) $500 will go to buying more copies of the book I am going to buy more copies of the book, so I can sell them to
  you all (and give some to a few folks as gifts - because it is
  essential that I be able to do that). $1000 will be invested in the launch party The
  launch party is important because celebrating things is important. It
  is also important because it is an opportunity to submerge ourselves
  in the magick of the material. There will be ritual, there will be
  dancing, there will be safer space under the stars where we can weave
  the magick of Jailbreaking, night breeze carressing naked skin, we
  will incant and enchant. This is a means and an end. This is magick.
  The money will secure the use of a space where we can dance and sleep
  and be naked and wild. Aumn. Yum. Yessss. (See the premiums related to
  this event. You know you want to be there.) $150 will help me ship out all the copies that are
  going to you lovely people, and any other premiums you purchase. $100 is for copy support. $200 is for various and sundry needs that are asking
  for my attention at the moment. Office supplies, software, this n thats. $3450 is my secondary, unofficial goal. HOW YOU CAN HELP: Spread the word about this fundraiser. A very cool way to do this that is not
    just asking for money but is sharing out value: you can share out a
    perk that you especially love! Make a pledge and get your goodies OR, if this fundraising thing is not
    your gig, reveiw Jailbreaking on GoodReads, your blog, for
    a print magazine Interview me for your podcast or radio show Tell your friends and family about the book! You all have helped Jailbreaking come into being. Thank you for
  helping yet again, and ensuring that Jailbreaking makes a gorgeous,
  powerful, vibrant splash. Or is that...SMASH? As in, smash
    patriarchy! I love all y'all. Thank you for your support. -Lasara",https://fundrazr.com/jailbreaking

  in their heart of hearts, should be about bringing children
  entertainment and wonderment. Their eyes should sparkle with
  excitement and dance with glee when they walk in. The idea of taking a
  store and making it much, much more is what inspired me to do this.
  This idea has been floating around in my mind for a long time now, and
  the circumstances are perfect for the idea to take root. I'm Candice, and I have a vision. I'm a spunky go-getter who wants to
  bring family, kids, and community together in a safe, fun environment
  that offers classes, events, and the fun of unique, interesting toys! The Lower Mainland has toy stores, but nothing in the Burnaby-New
  Westminster area that isn't just another big box store. When did it
  stop being magical? When did it stop being unique? I am hard at work, putting together a business plan, developing
  strategies, and finding the best of the best for my store, which will
  offer fun activities and a safe environment for kids to come with
  their parents. Not only will I sell toys, but offer educational
  seminars, events, and different community activities to bring young
  families together. For the young in age and young at heart, this store
  will be a place you'll definitely remember. To make this dream happen, I need your help. I've been able to do a
  lot, but need the support and donations from you and the community to
  help make this vision a reality. All donations will go directly into
  developing the space into something mystical and magical. It will help
  me paint, build and create a wonderland that kids and adults alike
  will remember! Together, we can make a magical place that allows kids to keep their
  innocence and experience the fun and whimsy of being kids!",https://fundrazr.com/toydreams
"4,290",Save The Shamrock Drive In: New Screen Drive,Canadian Dollar,,of $25k goal,50,17%,"My name is Joanne Struss.  My husband, Darren, and I own and operate
  the Shamrock Drive In Theatre in Killarney, Manitoba.  It was built in
  1953 and we purchased it from long time owner, Dorothy Gibson, in 2011. We knew the digital era was coming; It came fast.  Friends helped us
  organize some fund raising events to help offset the huge conversion
  cost from 35mm projectors to the new digital setup.  We also created
  this Fundrazr page at the request of those from out of town who wanted
  to give financially. Exactly a week after our first fundraising event, almost 1/2 of our
  screen was destroyed!  A lightening bolt struck the bottom of a main
  support beam along with extreme high winds and possible tornado activity. It was a huge blow....but we continued on.  The support was
  overwhelming.  We placed the insurance payout in our account and began
  making plans as to how best repair our screen and still afford to go digital. In March of 2016, we found a 3yr young digital set up from a previous
  Drive In owner in Idaho.  His asking price was within our grasp.
   After a bit of back and forth, we became the proud owners of a
  complete Christie digital package for our Drive In!! In June 2016, the last of our screen came down in an extreme wind
  storm.  The structure was not at its full capacity and the posts,
  placed in the 1950's, gave up their holds.  Repair is no longer an
  option.  We will come up with a solution to rebuild something that
  will withstand the winds in a more efficient manner. We we are thankful for all manner of support that we have received

590,Help Danielle get new awesome photos,U.S. Dollar,,of $900 goal,7,66%,"Your support of my acting career through the years has been amazing.
  Any dollar amount would be grately appreciated. Your belief in me,
  also means more than I can say. Thank you! Being an actor means having a small business start up each year, that
  I am running, marketing and funding on my own. My staff (my agents and
  managers) do what they can but it all falls on me, the founder, year
  after year. Head shots add up fast for the ""working actor ""(ME) -an
  actor who auditions at least 3 times a week, goes to callbacks almost
  as much. Plus, acting classes, casting director workshops, private
  coaching, etc. and then books an acting job here and there. My hope is
  to soon be a ""successful actor"" which would mean financially
  supported by my acting with no need for my day job or a fundraiser
  like this. Know, I am supremely grateful for any donation you may see fit to
  help me with this necessary expense toward my marketing. Biggest expense after getting the photos, is posting them on all
  three required sites (la casting, actors access, casting frontier) for
  casting notices that my agents and manager submit me through. And then
  let's add touchups and printing costs... Here is the breakdown of the cost to upload just 2 photos on these sites: LA casting: First photo $25. Second $15 Actors access: $15 per photo = $30 Casting frontier: $15 (yearly membership $65) and of course, $25 to change which Photo casting sees first UPDATE: I forgot to mention that because my
  commerical agent is separate from my theatrical agent and my manager
  is separate from them, I have to upload said pictures on 3 profiles
  and pay as those I am 3 people, instead of just me...How crazy is
  that? so about $300 to upload photos. Printing of at least 10 of each photo= $20 Here's the breakdown for the headshot session $150 hair $150 makeup
  $350 photo session $200 a few key wardrobe elements asked for by my agents. That brings me to my total goal of $900 p.s. Here's more crazy info- there have been years where just the
  photographer was $900 and then add those other expenses. The things I
  do to get my product out there;) Here's to all the auditions I will be getting this year and to those

"2,960",Get the Duck afloat!,U.S. Dollar,,of $18k goal,19,16%,"All of us have a dream. An idea, invention, or passion that keeps us
  going when times are tough, inspires us to go the extra mile, put in
  that extra hour; something that is there in our thoughts as we drift
  off to sleep and greets us when we wake in the morning. These dreams
  are not the winning lottery ticket fantasies, but the culmination of
  truly giving all of ourselves-going “all in”. For Christy and Jerry
  Cowan, that dream was going “all in” to run a dive shop in the Virgin
  Islands. They hooked their dream but the tide changed; now they are
  fighting with all they have to reel it back in. Now is our chance to
  grab hold with them, and not let their dream escape. Christy and Jerry grew up on the water; Christy right here on St.
  Thomas, a true Northside gal, and Jerry in the Pacific Northwest. The
  warm waters brought Jerry down to the Caribbean over a decade ago. For those fortunate enough to know Christy and Jerry, you already
  know that their generosity, kindness, and dedication know no bounds.
  Perhaps you’ve been lucky enough to have one of Christy’s amazing Oreo
  cupcakes, or been on a dive with Capt. Jerry and saw your first shark.
  Maybe you’ve gotten a good laugh from one of their three amazing kids.
  Maybe one of their four rescue dogs bathed you with slobbery kisses,
  or their two rescue donkeys greeted you as you parked for a cook out,
  or you even met one of their 12 tortoises! If you’ve been on St.
  Thomas for longer than a short visit, you’ve likely laughed till you
  cried at one of Christy’s unparalleled “Frenchie” stories. After falling head over heels for each other, Christy and Jerry
  realized that together, they could make their dreams of being on the
  water for a living and owning their own dive shop a reality. They
  worked around the clock to make their dream happen, and this spring
  they purchased Admiralty Dive Center. Together and with the help of
  their friends and family, they built out the new dive shop. They
  installed plumbing, electricity, and Jerry built amazing
  “Pinterest-worthy” weathered wood walls to make the dive shop truly
  memorable for divers. Only a few weeks into this new journey,
  Admiralty’s boat, the MR2 Duck, stopped working. Christy and Jerry
  feared the worst, but never retreated. The transmission was shot, and
  would need to be replaced. Weeks of work went into finding the new
  transmission and components, shipping the parts from all over the
  country, and installing it into The Duck. The new transmission wasn’t
  cheap, but the Duck couldn’t run without it, so Christy and Jerry
  buckled down and worked harder than ever before to make it happen.
  Finally, the new transmission was in the Duck and Admiralty was
  looking at a month of full dives and an amazing start to the next chapter. With the new transmission installed, the Duck chugged happily out on
  a dive trip on July 3, 2016. No one ever imagined that the Duck would
  return on floats, but fate is a cruel master. Thanks to the quick
  thinking of Capt. Jerry, Sea Tow, and the Coast Guard, everyone on
  that dive trip returned without injury. The Mighty Duck found a sandy
  spot to nest while SeaTow worked tirelessly to bring her up again.
  Even though the unimaginable happened to The Duck, Christy and Jerry
  held out hope that the Duck could be saved. They were insured, after all. Christy and Jerry, with the help of the boating community, saved The
  Duck. While they waited on their insurance, they continued operating
  the dive shop. Christy’s father and lifelong fisherman put his boat to
  work, and Admiralty Dive began exploring the beautiful reefs and
  underwater wonders on the Northside of St. Thomas. This meant
  transporting dozens of tanks and dive gear from Frenchtown to Hull Bay
  each day, but they never slowed down. After weeks of operating without
  The Duck, their insurance refused coverage. They continue to work from
  before light to after dark each day to make their dream reality, but
  it feels as if there is a rip tide pulling it farther out of reach.
  Christy and Jerry are not taking no for an answer from their insurer,
  but this battle could take weeks, months, possibly even years; The
  Duck cannot wait that long. Christy and Jerry never hesitate to give their time, talents and
  resources to someone in need. Christy and Jerry are part of this
  island. The Virgin Islands community means so much to Christy and
  Jerry, and part of their dream of Admiralty Dive was continuing to be
  part of their community, offering local diving opportunities,
  education, and recreation. Right now, Christy and Jerry are doing all they can to keep Admiralty
  Dive operating through this storm. Friends and family are helping
  around the clock, but The Duck needs more than they have right now.
  The Duck needs more work on the engine as well as new wiring and
  electronics. All these things cost money, and money is tight. The Duck
  can fly again, but Christy and Jerry need your help to make it happen.
  Any amount of support, big and small, will make a difference. Together
  we can make The Duck Mighty once more!",https://fundrazr.com/AdmiraltyDive

658,Shorter Research = Longer Lives. Make It Happen.,,,,,,"Cancer. Heart Disease. AIDS. Diabetes. There are researchers working
  diligently to find more effective treatments, and cures for these and
  most other medical conditions and diseases you can think of.
  Unfortunately, that research takes much longer than it needs
  to . Researchers, research ethics committees and research
  administrators all work overtime as it is to get ethical research
  studies up and running; by and large, it’s not possible for any of
  these people to work harder. So what’s the alternative? To work smarter . We have undertaken this project to establish a standard for wording
  that researchers and research ethics committees the world over,
  collectively spend at least a million hours negotiating back and
  forth, every year. This is part of the current research oversight
  system that adds zero value for research participants; if anything, it
  detracts value because everyone uses different wording to describe the
  same activities and risks involved in research studies. Even at the
  very same hospital, it’s possible for hundreds of different studies to
  have different language to describe the same things. Through the Shorter Research = Longer Lives project, we will
    permanently remove a million hours from the process of research
  oversight . Not only this year, but every year into the
  future. Imagine the possibilities of reinvesting a million
    hours back into the world’s healthcare systems,
  permanently! That’s a million more hours every year for
  researchers to plan and undertake new and exciting research, and for
  research ethics committees to focus on their important role of
  ensuring that the research studies are ethical, and that research
  participants are informed, and protected. Let’s make it happen. Awesome! How Can I Help? There are three ways you can help research happen faster: Share the campaign with your social networks by clicking one of

    8 hours. For the purposes of calculating these perks, 1 week = 40 work hours. Our 52-week calendar doesn’t divide up equally into 4 weeks/month,
    which is why it appears that the math doesn’t add up in the perks. However, those extra 4 weeks sneak into each three-month quarter
    of the year, and figures are rounded up or down accordingly. Who is spearheading this project? You might be wondering who thought up this project, and has been the
  driving force behind it. Josh Leslie, the founder of Stewardly shares
  a bit of his story and his reasons for undertaking this work in this
  short video: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Q: How do researchers provide better care to you, me and everyone? A: A great and important question! Perhaps it is best to start with what research is not. Research is
  not clinical care. It is the rigorous scientific process by which we
  as a society, advance the state of our medical knowledge, and perform
  experiments (in research studies) to find out whether or not new
  methods or health products (drugs, devices, natural health products,
  biologics and genetic therapies, etc.) improve health outcomes. This is a common misunderstanding on the part of research
  participants (the people who decide to take part in research studies).
  So common, that there is a term for it, called “therapeutic
  misconception”. Here is the definition of therapeutic misconception,
  from the Tri-Council Policy Statement : “ Therapeutic Misconception: A misunderstanding, on
  the part of participants, of the purpose, benefits, and/or risks of
  clinical trials. Often participants do not understand that research is
  aimed primarily at producing knowledge and may not provide any
  therapeutic benefit to them.” So our healthcare professionals can provide us with better care as a result of the work of researchers, and the research
  studies that they complete. Hence the “Shorter Research” part of the
  name of this project; the faster that researchers can initiate and
  complete research studies, the better the state of our medical
  knowledge, which means healthcare professionals learn important things
  that help them provide better care for their patients. Sometimes this
  is a new health product or medical innovation, and sometimes this is
  simply because they have a better understanding of how to provide the
  right treatment, to the right person, at the right time — the goal of
  personalized medicine. Q: Why do you ask for a minimum $5 donation? A: We ask for a minimum $5 donation because of the
  way crowdfunding platforms and payment processing companies (like
  PayPal) work. In a nutshell, they take the most money in fees off of
  the first $1 in each transaction. What’s left is ~60 cents or less of
  that dollar. To explain the impact of this, consider what would happen if 125,000
  people each gave $1 to help us reach our goal. Well, unfortunately
  we’d raise only 60% of $125,000 ($75,000 total), and wouldn’t be able
  to undertake our project until another 83,333 people also gave $1! A $1 minimum donation means that 208,333 people would have to give
  $208,333 in total donations for us to reach our campaign goal of
  $125,000. That isn’t math we like, and we don’t think you should like
  it either! Let’s get more specific in our calculations: From the 1st dollar, $0.38 (approximately) is taken, leaving $0.62
    for this project. From the 2nd dollar, only $0.08 (approximately) is taken, leaving
    $1.54 for this project. From the 3rd dollar, only $0.08 (approximately) is taken, leaving
    $2.46 for this project. From the 4th dollar, only $0.08 (approximately) is taken, leaving
    $3.38 for this project. From the 5th dollar, only $0.08 (approximately) is taken, leaving
    $4.3 for this project. [...] From the 33rd dollar, only $0.08 (approximately) is taken, leaving
    $30.06 for this project. Donating $5 then, means giving 7x as much as giving $1. Donating $33 means giving 48x as much as giving $1 .
  That’s math we like, where everybody wins. It would only take just over 29,000 people giving $5 each to reach
  our campaign goal, with $145,349 total donations. Giving more, brings
  the total donation amount required down even further. Taking $33 as an
  example, $30.06 goes to the campaign. So it would only take just over
  4100 people giving $33 each to reach our campaign goal, with $137,226
  total donations. Don’t get us wrong; we’re very thankful that platforms like FundRazr
  and payment processing companies like PayPal exist. Otherwise we
  couldn’t do this campaign! We just believe in your money having
  maximum impact factor, with more of it going to the actual project,
  and less of it going to the platform and processing companies. To support the calculations above, here is the fee structure of
  FundRazr + PayPal, as taken from the FundRazr website: “Recipients pay 5% FundRazr fee plus Payment Provider fee of 2.9% + 30¢* per transaction."" Q: You are running 2 crowdfunding campaigns simultaneously: one for
    the general public, and one for the research community .
    Are you ""double-dipping""? A: This is a valid concern to have, but
  rest assured that this is not the case. The reason we are running 2
  campaigns simultaneously, is for two main reasons: The different communities (general public vs. research) require
    different levels of detail with respect to this project. The ""perks"" for each of these communities are different. We searched for a crowdfunding platform that would be able to support
  having the total amount raised for both campaigns roll up into an
  overall 'master' total, and thought that we would be able to
  accomplish this via FundRazr, the platform we ended up selecting.
  However, unfortunately the current FundRazr platform only supports #1
  and cannot support #2. This caused a delay in launching our campaign
  to the research community, which was an unanticipated technical issue,
  and for which we apologize. This also means that in order to keep the total in each campaign
  updated accurately, once a week we will have to manually 'sync' the
  funds raised. For the duration of both campaigns we will do this, and
  publish an update when the funds have been added. By way of concrete
  example, if $1000 is raised in one week via the research community
  campaign, we will manually add that to the total for the general
  public campaign, and then post an update letting followers of our
  general public campaign know. More Q&A to be added throughout the campaign, as questions arise! Images © Stewardly. All Rights Reserved.",https://fundrazr.com/2nFgc
"10,825",Doug Burgoyne Legacy Scholarship,Canadian Dollar,,of $20k goal,63,54%,"This endowment is to honour our friend and entrepreneur, Doug
  Burgoyne. Doug left us a year ago after a valiant battle against
  cancer but has remained firmly in the hearts and minds of his family,
  friends and colleagues. Doug passionately believed that business and social responsibility
  were ultimately connected and that by combining profits with a higher
  purpose, a deeper level of success could be achieved. He believed in
  the concept of sustainable prosperity, a vision that views an
  organization’s success as financial progress in step with
  environmental and socially responsible principals. Doug, personally and through his company Frogbox , cared about people and the planet. He
  became widely recognized as a business leader, after being featured on
  the Dragon’s Den, and winning, and has served as an inspiration to the
  business community at large It’s clear that in his short life, Doug hade a tremendous impact on
  business. Perhaps most importantly though, he was known as true and
  trusted friend a devoted and caring father and a loving and committed
  husband.  We are deeply grateful for the work and the passion that
  Doug brought to life and are dedicated to continuing his legacy
  through this endowment. The recipient of the money raised here will receive a full
  scholarship to Social Venture Institute at Hollyhock where they will
  have access to the same experiences, information and contacts that
  were part of Doug’s success story. Every dollar donated will go into
  the fund and any extra monies will go toward future bursaries.",https://fundrazr.com/9yh31
135,Ayúdenos a salvar el sueño de un taxista!,,,,,,"Al quedarse sin trabajo y quemarse su auto particular, el taxista
  cubano Felix Arguelles ha perdido las dos principales vías de sustento
  de su familia. Pero está a punto de perder algo mucho más valioso: su
  sueño empresarial. Gracias por considerar una donacion a esta causa y compartir
    este enlace con sus amigos. Apreciamos su apoyo! El SUEÑO DE FELIX En diciembre 2013, el Sr. Arguelles tenía dos trabajos: uno como
  taxista trabajando para la empresa estatal CubaTaxi y otro como
  taxista privado utilizando su carro particular (a quien llama Helix).
  También tenía un sueño ambicioso: fundar una agencia de taxi privada
  con 5 a 10 carros y choferes élites. LA PRIMERA PÉRDIDA En enero 2014, Felix quedó sin trabajo con Cubataxi cuando el auto
  que manejaba se rompió y no se pudo reparar. Ha estado entonces cerca
  de 9 meses sin poder trabajar y sin ganar nada por esa vía. Le quedaba
  su taxi particular y con eso pudo lograr ganarse algun dinerito. LA SEGUNDA PÉRDIDA En junio de este año, mientras chapisteaba su carro particular,
  ocurrió un accidente fatal. Por un error del chapista, el carro sufrió
  quemaduras en el área del motor que lo dejó inservible. La empresa
  aseguradora lo declar baja técnica. No obstante, Felix no se cruzó de brazos, inició y mantuvo gestiones
  con la agencia aseguradora cubana para ver si podian reponerle su auto
  con otro de segunda mano. A comienzo de este mes, se conoció el
  veredicto: sólo iban a darle 9000 pesos cubanos (~375 CUC /~430 USD)
  que solo alcanza para comprar un parabrisas nuevo. Opciones actuales Para mantener a su familia, Arguelles se ha asociado con otros
  choféres para ofrecer city tours a visitantes extranjeros gracias a
  sus conocimientos del tema y dominio de varios idiomas. Este trabajo
  es ocasional, pero ayuda en algo a la economía de su familia. Pronto
  tampoco podrá realizar este trabajo pues tiene 67 años y formalmente
  la edad de retiro obligatorio es 65. Aunque se siente relativamente fuerte y no piensa que es muy viejo
  aún, él ha estado de acuerdo en someterse a pruebas médicas y estudios
  clinicos ya que existe sospecha de que pueda tener problemas de salud
  relacionados con cáncer de prostata. Sin embargo, no tiene miedo ya
  que su misma esposa es una sobreviviente de cáncer. Sin embargo, lo principal para Arguelles es poder reparar su auto no
  sólo para buscarse su propio dinero sino para poder lograr
  eventualmente su sueño. En su situación actual es prácticamente imposible lograr esto. El
  costo de la reparación es alrededor de 7 mil USD (~6000 CUC) y por
  ahora solo cuenta con los $500 USD (~400 cuc) que le dará la aseguradora. SOBRE ESTA PÁGINA DE RECAUDACIÓN DE FONDOS Aconsejado por su hijo, Felix ha estado de acuerdo en la creación de
  ésta página para facilitar la ayuda en forma de donación de
  familiares, amistades, antiguos clientes y cualquier otra persona
  deseosa de contribuir con esta causa. La meta es lograr reunir $6500 USD. Cualquier cantidad es agradecida
  y apreciada pues nos acercaría un poco más a la meta para lograr
  reparar a Helix. La esperanza es que Helix renazca de las cenizas como
  el ave Fénix. Aún sin contar con la cantidad total, se empezará a reparar el carro
  y se actualizará el progreso de la reparación. Las personas que ayuden tienen también la promesa de Félix de
  ofrecerles un city tour por la Habana libre de costo cuando Helix haya
  renacido, en agradecimiento por su buena y noble acción. Si no puede
  ayudar financieramente, quizás pueda recomendar a viajeros a Cuba a
  utilizar el servicio de guía turístico de Félix a través de su
    viejo sitio . Su ayuda es importante. Gracias por ayudar a salvar un sueño! Contacto Si Ud. desea contactar a Felix, por favor, llámelo al (+53-7) 764

630,Young Kings Mobile App Development,U.S. Dollar,,of $800 goal,9,79%,"Young Kings Mobile App Development: Phase II Please watch video to see the latest stage... Hi! My name is King Daniel and I am 10 years old. I was born in
  Washington, DC, but I've lived in different parts of the country;
  Kansas, Colorado and Florida. I enjoy playing video games, beating all
  video games, watching Jessie, Lab Rats, WWE, traveling and acting in
  plays. I want to own my own business, earning money selling products
  and testing video games. What is the project that I'm working on to inspire young boys
    and teenagers? Do you love to download apps? If yes, so do I. I'm always looking for
  new games and something fun to do. Recently, my mom and I were
  discussing fun things that I like to do and what can I do using my
  talents to help others? Technology and using computers comes easy for
  me so I decided that I wanted to create an app that does something
  that I don't see currently in the app store, that's an app that is
  specifically designed to encourage boys, especially Black male youth. Why is the Young Kings App needed? The Young Kings mobile app is designed to empower, inspire and
  encourage male youth daily. The following features on the app will be
  used as tools for daily inspiration for school, chores, sports,
  creating goals and when things aren't going as you hoped: Inspirational Quotes for young boys & teenagers Brain Game Links Select Speeches by famous speakers & child entrepreneurs Exclusive ability to see content from Young Global Leaders Travel Inspiration Connections to Opportunities & Programs for male youth Young Eagles information Entrepreneurial ideas for kids Savings Tips Essay Writing Tips Scholarship Information College Information My mom helped me come up with that list. :) I want to see all of my
  friends be leaders and do their best. If I can help them with this
  app, then I've done something with my talent besides playing games.
  With your help, this app can show the importance of creating things
  that are meant to inspire boys and more boys will find things to make
  their own money. The Young Kings app will be on sale for $0.99 as my
  first product as an entrepreneur. The not fun part... (Mom's part) The Original Cost to Develop the Young Kings App: App Development & Design $680 Apple Store Submission Costs $99 Google Play Store Submission Costs $25 App Monthly Hosting Fee $50 App Monthly Maintenance Fee $55 The previous quote for the total Young Kings App costs for one full
  year was $2200. Since we've originally designed this project we've
  been able to narrow costs down to $800 for the first full year from
  estimates given by a new reputable mobile app developer. No donation is too small. Our first deadline for Official App Sponsors is July 31, 2016. All other Sponsorship will be inserted into the app on a rolling basis. When can we expect to see the Young Kings App in Apple &
    Google Play Stores? The app turnover time is estimated at 3-5 weeks from start to finish.
  We are hoping that with your help the Young Kings App can be in the
  Apple and Google Play stores by November 2016. Do you know or are you a local business owner? We are looking for sponsors. Sponsors of the Young Kings app are
  those who contribute $150 or more to this fundraiser. Sponsors will
  receive recognition by being listed within the Young Kings app. What else can you do if you aren't able to donate? If you think this is a great idea, then please share it with friends
  and family. Please subscribe to this page to find out when the Young
  Kings app is live so you can help spread the word. Find us on Facebook & share the message: www.facebook.com/createYoungKings",https://fundrazr.com/YoungKingsApp
"1,700",Solace Radio,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.5k goal,20,113%,"Recently in light of equipment and software failure, a negative
  effect on the ability for our daily operation costs to be met has arisen. Solace Radio has, for nearly ten years, been housed in the same small
  temporary area, and we need a more secure facility which would provide
  a larger work space that would enable us to expand the ministry to
  meet the goals we set several years ago. This fundraiser is for the purpose of funding the operations,
  development, and continued expansion of Solace Radio. The goal is for a year of operating costs and expenses. Your giving
  may be the difference between broadcasting to the World or Not. At this time, we can not foresee continued broadcasting after
  November 2016, which will mark the tenth year we have been on the air.
  Without your monthly support Solace Radio may go off the air .
  As you know, we do not bombard you each hour with plea's for help, nor
  blanket your mail with donation pleas. We have relied on prayer and
  for Adonai (The Father) to show us how to operate with as little
  expense as we can. At this time, and for much of the almost ten years
  on the air, the monthly donors numbered less that five. As frugal as
  we are, we must turn to our listeners to help us continue this
  important ministry. Since Solace Radio went on the air in Novermber 2006, we have reached
  every major city in the United States, and hundreds of small towns in
  between with the Word of Yeshua (Jesus). Your donations and our own
  small personal funds have made it possible to reach new believers in
  184 countries- thousands of people, and changed lives all over the
  globe. You few who have helped and Solace Radio, with Adonai's strong
  help have done this! People have tuned in over five million hours to
  hear the Word. For those who aren't familiar with Solace Radio, we are a
  non-denominational, Messianic and Messianic Jewish-focused broadcast,
  for those who prefer a whole-Bible in-depth study of the Scriptures.
  We broadcast studies of Torah (the first five books of the Bible, the
  prophets / prophecy and end times events, and the other scriptures in
  the 'Old Testament' (Tanach), word studies that open up understanding
  on a deeper level. With Yeshua (Jesus) as our risen savior and means
  of our salvation, we also broadcast current events and news as it
  relates to Biblical prophecy. The name ""Yeshua"" (some say
  ""Yehoshua"" or similar terms) was used in biblical times, and
  is the Hebraic form of the Messiah's name. We help listeners gain the
  skills needed by any believer to become well-versed in Biblical truth,
  in order to share it with others. Other concerns for our listeners are
  surviving in our current economy, things happening with food and the
  food supply, their children and schooling, gardening; and Kosher
  (biblical) foods. Your adequate donations will enable Solace Radio to continue to be
  available each day of each week providing a free daily broadcast to
  help those who know His Word and reach those who need to understand,
  especially in the times which are upon us. Please help if you can! Your adequate and faithful monthly
  donations/tithes can keep us on the air. It all hinges on our listener
  donations, now. We are at a critical time in our broadcasting history,
  and we hope you will pray about this and choose to help the ministry
  continue. We don't have a ""Board"" to fundraise or help us,
  as we are not a 501C3 corporation and have never been. It's just two
  people doing all this work. Much love to everyone who has helped over the past 10 years! We hope
  we can continue bringing you the finest quality programming. Blessings and shalom in Yeshua, Dianne & Eric Solace Radio",https://fundrazr.com/d1ACb4
110,Please kickstart Borneo agro-ecological research,U.S. Dollar,,of $35k goal,4,0%,"I'm Dr. Lenard Milich , and I'm the advisor for the
  Central Kalimantan Agro-Ecology Research Center at Bogor Agricultural University . I
  want to introduce you to an amazing and threatened forest in Central
  Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) that harbors the highest density of
  orang utans found in all of Borneo. I first entered the peat forests
  of Central Kalimantan as the team leader of the socio-economic impact assessment of a large sustainable development- forest conservation pilot project
  in Indonesia. One of the local people in the communities we visited
  told me that a bunch of orang utans lived across the river from his
  village. Later that year, during school vacation, I returned to that
  village with my 8-year old daughter, to see if we could see wild orang
  utans - which we did, as you can see from the photo on this fundraiser. It turns out that this little scrap of disturbed tropical peat swamp
  forest  - just 200 ha (500 acres) in size - contains the highest
  density of orang utans in all Borneo (the Curator of Primates at the
  Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, DC studied this patch for
  her doctoral dissertation research – I can provide the reference to
  anyone interested). This high density is most assuredly due to the
  fact that the forest is a remnant of a once larger tract and has
  become a refuge for these animals from the devastation of their
  habitat by oil palm plantations. And although we know a lot about the
  behavior of wild orang utans, we don't know how to get them (and other
  endangered or threatened Bornean animals, such as proboscis monkeys,
  sun bears, clouded leopards, and pangolins) to move from one forest
  patch to another. What kind of corridors do we need to create to help
  them move between forest islands? How do we stop them from eating the
  fruit off the trees local people planted? How do we prevent them from
  stripping the bark off the rubber trees (thus killing them) on which
  the local Dayak people depend for income when, during the dry season
  when fruit are scarce, the rubber trees' inner bark (the cambium)
  offers one of only a few sources of food? Human-wildlife conflicts are
  all too common here, as elsewhere in the world, and it is always the
  wildlife that pay the price. This challenge of finding ways to both accommodate human
  socioeconomic needs while protecting wild nature and ecosystem
  processes that support human societies has been called the
  ""conservation divide."" If we want to make sure that nature
  continues providing for people's livelihoods and well-being, we must
  keep ecosystem processes intact. At the same time, many of us wish to
  preserve nature for nature's sake - that is, keep animals in a
  benevolent Eden. Unfortunately, too often these are incompatible
  goals. Bridging this divide is the new
  frontier in conservation, and it's the central focus of this proposed
  research center. We at Bogor Agricultural University are eager to undertake the
  research (broadly outlined in this Concept Note ), and serve as the
  host institution to foreign faculty researchers and graduate students.
  We anticipate mobilizing corporate CSR funds to build and equip the
  center, and have commenced preliminary discussions with several likely
  candidates. But as an indication of global interest in this
    landscape ecology approach, and as a stimulus to create government
    and corporate support, we are crowd-funding the very first step : architectural drawings for the center, and an engineering
    feasibility study. The concept we have for the building is bold. To be located on a
  previously burned, now grassy area across a small peatwater stream
  from the forest, the center will be both state-of-the-art and
  off-grid. It will be constructed in part from fallen logs that are in
  the peatwater stream, which because of the tannins are now rock-hard
  and insect-resistant. It will be circular in shape, with a donut hole
  in its center to act as a heat convector to draw in cooling breezes
  from around its periphery. It is to be roofed with solar cells. And
  among the research activities will be an investigation into local
  non-oil-palm options for biofuel to run the shuttle boats' outboard
  motors, so that we can be wholly carbon-neutral. There is an innovative, highly creative architectural firm in Vietnam
  with stellar and award-winning ""green"" concepts that has
  agreed to draw up the design. Have a look at their projects - I particularly like their 'Farming Kindergarten'! The output will include: - 3D images - 3 exteriors (main view x 2, 1 night view), 2 interior
  (1 hall and a room) - Single line facility basic plans -
  scale:1/300, 4 stories - 1 Section - reasonable scale - 1
  Section Diagram to show the sustainable idea of the building -
  Architectural English description - A powerpoint presentation
  data for architectural concept Help us get started! We will respond to all donors who wish
  to be kept informed not only with our thanks, but with progress
  updates. And maybe one day you can come to visit the center, for a
  section of it will be used for ecotourism – a model for how forest
  communities can directly benefit from biodiversity.",https://fundrazr.com/d12o10
100,Help Kindle Rashod Launch Music Business,U.S. Dollar,,of $24k goal,2,0%,"Birth of a Visionary Hello, winners. I'm Kindle Rashod, a rap artist who writes
        music for goal-oriented people. I've been making music for about
        20 years. I started out at the age of 11 when my friends decided
        to imitate a popular hip-hop group at the time, Master P and the
        No Limit Soldiers. I've been hooked ever since. My Career Experiences Fast forward 7 years later, I attended Cuyahoga Community
        College studying music production, music business, internet
        marketing, and entrepreneurship. I performed shows at various
        places in Ohio. In 2011, I started an online music consulting
        service, but it failed due to lack of sales. In 2013, I joined
        an A&R company called Team Mashin', working under music
        producer Keith Clizark and head of A&R Kenneth James.
        Although it was a great team, I left because the audience I
        wanted to cater to wasn't the same as the market that the
        company wanted to attract. My departure was on good terms. I'm now in a new chapter in my life with the desire to
        reincarnate my original business idea: consulting. The exception
        here is that I learned to develop a much bigger vision, which is
        to offer my service to growth-minded artists in the entire
        creative industry, not just musicians. What This Campaign is About The Target Audience There are millions of hip-hop musicians in the market:
        gangsta rappers, party rappers, conscience rappers, Christian
        rappers, nerdcore, and so forth. So how do I stand out? My music caters to artistic workers with high ambitions,
        including visual artists, photographers, filmmakers, video game
        developers, actors, models, singers, technology innovators,
        bloggers, and more. My lyrics resonate with the thoughts and
        behaviors of creative people and their desire for success. The Business Model My music career is multi-faceted. I'm developing an
        international brand to encourage creative artists in running
        their business much more efficiently. I will provide music, digital content, software, and other
        products supporting their mental, artistic, and professional
        growth. My purpose is to make individuals feel optimistic about
        their own visions. I started this campaign with the faith to
        make these ideas come to pass. What You Can Do To Help I am establishing myself as a musician with a
        forward-thinking business. That's where I need your help. The
        end goal is to raise $24,000 by November 12. When this campaign
        succeeds, the money will be invested in marketing, product
        development, equipment/supplies, and operation costs. Click here to download a
          detailed expense list . Make a donation today, even if it's only $1, and continue to
        give more over time. Contributing even a little bit will inspire
        other people to give as well. This will ensure we raise $24,000
        before the deadline. Please Consider $100 Although you are free to give whatever you can, please
        consider a minimum of $100. You do not have to donate a lump sum
        in a single transaction. You can contribute over time. This
        amount will help attract many more funders. How You Will Benefit From Contributing You will receive perks, as listed on this site You'll be supporting a vision to help bring other artistic
      entrepreneurs to the forefront, thereby adding more value to our cultures. You'll be reminded of the power of networking and how
          effective word-of-mouth can be for your own cause. You may learn new promotional ideas, whether you are
          marketing savvy or not. You prove to yourself that you like to see other people
          win. That makes you a winner, too. You'll have fun. It will be like watching your favorite
          sports team with the winning score, or watching a suspense
          movie as the campaign gets closer to its goal. So make a donation now so we can grow together. See the vision. Join
  the team. Join the fun. Thanks. P.S. Follow me on Twitter , LinkedIn , YouTube , RSS , and my website . And last but not least, download my free music

  to the conclusion i cannot do it without your help... The plan is pretty simple - buy stocks of used / non working pcs from
  ebay and other retail online shops, repair them my self, and ship them
  to those who need them most. For that purpose ill setup a website - i
  already bought the domain - http://trumot.online where kids
  and people from any where can ask for a pc. their only cost will be
  the shipment fee(around 60$ to the furthest locations like australia
  and the us - but the pc is for free!! of course ill try to ship for free if it is not possible for that
  person to pay the fee, and hopefully that will incourge others like me
  who just want to help, to do the same... just so u get an idea of where the money will be spent - here is a
  sample of a sale in ebay - http://ebay.to/2ns066H for  30
  laptops for the price of 470$ with shipping, (about 15.6 $ per
  laptop), which will make 30 families happier and be able to provide a
  common houshold product that allows them to learn and evolve in a

505,Please Help Launch Brooklyn Treasures Uncovered,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,12,5%,"Hi, My name is Akosua Albritton, a resident of Brooklyn, and I'm on a
  mission to move Brooklyn from an ""outer borough"" to Brooklyn
  front and center. I'm growing a tour guide business called Brooklyn Treasures Uncovered that offers a nature
  walk, neighborhood walks,  presentations, a tour of churches, and
  visits to places of interests. New itineraries pop out of my head. Before starting Brooklyn Treasures Uncovered , I
  taught a Summer Intensive that was called History of Blacks in
  Brooklyn for 11 years at a local college. My adult learners
  brought their families and friends along to enjoy the places we
  visited and listen to my talks. It was a fun way to learn. When a
  friend heard my description of my class, she said, "" You
    should turn it into a business--just don't give them tests ."" It took me a few years to act on my friend's suggestion. Then, I
  approached a public high school (Erasmus Hall High) to promote it as
  an afterschool program. While the school considered it, I began taking
  members of senior centers out to places and did presentations at a
  community room, a church, and under the Sailors and Soldiers Monument
  at Grand Army Plaza. So my business needs fuel to grow and thrive. It needs
    $11,000 for essential business set up , sales &
  marketing, and product development. Will you please chip in
    $35, $50, $100 or more to get this business on firm
  ground?  I have great thank you gifts for your support.  The details
  are in another section. Last thing, Brooklyn waft it's magic on me years ago when I
    took the A train the wrong direction. Instead of heading
  to lower Manhattan, the train went deeper into Brooklyn. I got off at
  the Nostrand Avenue stop.  I walked up the stairs to the surface to
  find religious groups promoting themselves--one on each of the four
  corners. One corner had Shango Baptists dressed in red and white,
  another had Hebrew Israelites who I intially thought were pirates, the
  other had clean cut Nation of Islam reps, and the fourth had a nearby
  Christian church member reading from the Bible. I had never seen such
  a spectacle. Four years later, I moved to Brooklyn five blocks away
  from the past spectacle.",https://fundrazr.com/91DR29
155,A potentially highly efficacious drug for stroke,Pound Sterling,,of £500k goal,7,0%,"What is carnosine? Carnosine is a small molecule that is found naturally in different
  parts of the body including the various cells of the brain. There is
  substantial published scientific literature that supports the view
  that Carnosine has many beneficial effects on the body and may even
  slow down ageing. Carnosine is a versatile molecule in that it protects the brain from
  immediate and long-term stresses and dangers. It has been shown that
  Carnosine is a powerful antioxidant and a feel radical scavenger but
  its benefits go well beyond this property. For example, Carnosine has
  been shown to inhibit excitotoxicity. (Excitoxicity is the excessive
  and toxic release of a neurotransmitter called glutamate from damaged
  brain cells during stroke). Excitotoxicity damages surrounding
  uninjured cells which may have survived the initial injury caused by
  stroke. It also buffers the acidic environment in the brain that is
  created by the stroke which is injurious to brain cells.
  Significantly, it inhibits enzymes called matrix-metalloproteinases
  that are released from damaged brain tissue. These enzymes break down
  the architecture of surrounding normal cells and increase brain damage
  and reduce the chances of recovery. When was it first discovered and what does the research show? Carnosine was first discovered over 100 years ago but its potential
  medicinal benefits have only recently been unravelling. There is
  considerable interest in Carnosine as an anti-ageing molecule and many
  people around the world are taking Carnosine purchased from health
  food stores to slow down ageing and prevent dementia because some
  studies show that it can enhance cognition in humans. Carnosine may help to protect the brain from stroke Scientists also believe that Carnosine may protect the brain from
  stroke if it is given to patients soon after their stroke symptoms
  start. A neurologist and neuroscientist, Professor Arshad Majid at the
      University of Sheffield in England did a series of experiments
    in cellular and animal models of stroke and has shown that Carnosine
    can protect the brain against experimental stroke. This is
  a considerable discovery because no protective drugs currently exist
  which protect the brain when stroke occurs. Although clot-busting
  medications are occasionally used for patients suffering from stroke,
  side-effects and other timing factors mean that only a small fraction
  of patients suffering from stroke will receive these medicines. However, Carnosine with its multiple beneficial effects highlighted
  above may protect the brain from stroke in humans if it is given in
  the vein. Professor Majid said that further testing is needed before
  this medication can be tested in human trials. However, this testing cannot be carried out because there is no
      patent being held by anyone. This means that large
  pharmaceutical companies will not be able to make a profit on this
  medication even if it is successfully developed for human use.
  Consequently, a potentially valuable and efficacious drug cannot be
  developed any further due to lack of commercial interest. Professor
  Majid wants to develop this exciting molecule if funding was available
  to complete the extra experiments that are needed before clinical
  testing in humans can begin.

  away from society and to the place they would one day retire would
  cause a chain reaction that started with building a simple sustaining ecosystem. We give hens love, food and shelter -> hens give us poop and eggs We give bees love, food and shelter -> bees give honey and pollination We plant a garden with fertilizer from the chickens and
    pollination from the bees and we have food. A little circle of life. Simple, with purpose and sustainability.  Ahhhh, best laid plans -

  like-minded consumers. What FCVFM provides is: A connection to Partner Farmers, their farming practices and
    social media feeds.  Fall in love with your producer. Meat, Poultry and Dairy from animals who are humanely raised,
    green and sustainably grown. Support for the local community, what you pay for product goes
    directly to the farmer. Delivery of your order, in its own cooler, to the workplace, using
    safe meat handling practices. Information on the farming industry and how Small Farms seem to be
    the only REAL alternative to what supermarkets provide today. FCVFM is committed to: Enabling small farms to continue to provide the food that is
    needed and wanted by the public. Providing our customers an easy way to get farmers market quality
    meats without going to the Farmers Market. Helping to save time for
    the busy consumer. Humane, sustainable and green agriculture – even if the farm
    cannot afford to be certified. Becoming a trusted source for our customers, doing the due
    diligence to find small farms who share the values of our customers,
    so that our customers don’t have to. Supporting local business from the counties surrounding the RTP
    area, investing in our community. Working with our partner farmers to build on success and make more

205,Help Make Digital Nomads And Social Entrepreneurs,U.S. Dollar,,of $2k goal,2,10%,"I am Bright Geofrey Kata , Ugandan born and CEO and
  founder at KataTimes.Com and WorldForPhotos.Com . Having graduated at United World Colleges Costa
  Rica earlier this year, I decided to take a year
  travelling to get to know the world better, and offer help whenever I
  could after integrating into different cultures. While travelling in Ecuador, I kept open minded about new ideas, and
  ''Digital Nomadism'' is one of the many that caught my attention. A Digital Nomad is a person who uses technology to
  work everywhere in the world. It caught my interest because being from
  Uganda and just like other Bottom Of The Pyramid countries in terms of
  economics, there is not that many opportunities for youths and
  business owners to use technology for social causes, and to earn a
  living to support themselves and their families (Tuition, Medication,
  clean clothes, food e.t.c) WHAT DID I DO IN ECUADOR? Taught Enlish in a local school in Pedernales, Montanita, that had
    been destroyed by Earthquakes, and thus lacked enough teachers, as
    most of them stayed home taking care of their families. Volunteered in Hostels e.g Hidden House Hostel, Montanita,
    teaching spanish to backpackers, that found it difficult to have
    conversations with locals. Taught hip hop dancing, and inspired young children to follow
    their dancing dreams. Me and my dance team helped create the
    choreography in a local Music video. Feel free to watch it below. Having been inspired by Digital Nomads and a couple of other mentors
  over the last months, I plan to be travelling through Asia ( Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Hongkong ) organizing Entrepreneurship
  Conferences where I can teach fellow youths not only to be Digital
  Nomads, but also Global change makers. That is, by using technology,
  and their innovation skills to solve problems in their communities,
  and also be able to contribute to other social causes when they earn
  money from digital nomadism. I ask for your help because originally, I wanted to fund all my
  projects from my online websites' ( Kata
  Times and World For Photos ) revenue, but since
  I only set them up, a few months ago, a bit more time is needed before
  I can start earning money and helping other entrepreneurs and digital
  nomads financially, in addition to paying for my travel, accomodation
  and organising conferences. The money you donate will be used for; Organizing conferences, and funding communal projects - $1,000 Micro loans to young entrepreneurs (To be offered to other
    entrepreneurs when paid back.) - $500 Transport, food and Accomodation - $500 What Do I plan To Do With The KataTimes.Com And
      WorldForPhotos.Com revenue from my websites in the near future? Buy computers to be donated to Digital Nomads attending my
    conferences and in local schools in Asia, Africa, and other
    developing parts of the world. Sponsor Entrepreneurship and Digital Nomadism conferences, that
    will inspire more people to become social entrepreneurs and thus
    problem solvers. Pay for flights and other expenses incurred by my team and I, when
    travelling from country to country to inspire more digital nomads
    and entrepreneurs. Pay shipping fees for donors offering digital products (for
    example Cameras and computers) to people all over the world that can
    not afford them. What Additional Social Projects Will I Work On? Social Supermarket: This will be a market set up specifically to sell low cost products
  to the poor. Products that need to be consumed fast before expiring
  will either be bought at a fraction of the original price or donated
  by big super markets, farmers, and other producers. Social Library: With lots of tourism in Asia, I plan to make partnershis with
  hostels, in that whenever book donations are made by backpackers and
  other travellers, they are shipped to communal libraries. I will pay
  for the first month f rent, and the following months of rent can be
  paid for through small donations from the community. Cooking For A Social Cause: Not every child gets an opportunity to go to school and this makes it
  had for some youths to take care of themselves. Some end up taking
  drugs, getting involved in robberies and many other bad habits.
  However, by setting up restaurants where these teens can learn to cook
  and make sales, they will break their habits and restore their lost
  hope of being able to do something good for themselves. The money
  earned from selling the food will be used to take care of them, and
  also pay them for their services Education Travel Company: With many travelers in Asia, there is a lot to be gained by the local
  communities they visit. Programs offered to the local community could
  include language courses, educational tutoring, and many other
  experiences. All money raised in micro payments for attendance is to
  be used for supporting the local communities. Quotes & Food For Thought: The best way to get ''The Bottom Of The Pyramid population'' out
    of poverty is by making sure they can provide for themselves. “It's not how much we give but how much love we put into
      giving.” ― Mother Teresa “The simplest acts of kindness are by far more powerful than a
      thousand heads bowing in prayer.” ― Mahatma Gandhi Please Donate Any Where Between $1-$200 , to help

    customize it to suit your needs. E-commerce websites as well. Write you a personal thank you note. And to every donor, I will keep you all updated on the progress of my
  social entrepreneurship venture. Also, I will be glad to receive ideas
  from you and hopefully make collaborations in the near future to help
  more Global Citizens achieve their dreams. What Motivates Me To Teach Entrepreneurs And Digital Nomads

  people are soil-blind and “treat soil like dirt.” Through the
  knowledge and wisdom revealed in this film, we can come to respect,
  even revere, this miraculous substance, and appreciate that treating
  the soil right can help solve some of our most pressing environmental problems. The arts center is a 501(c) (3) not-for-profit organization that

    local dog washes. From that frustration Scrub-A-Pup was born! We
    also have to give credit to Elisabeth (Emily's entrepreneurial
    daughter) whose dream has always been to have, and help run a family business. We're so excited to start our business and serve our community
    with Laveen's first independent self-serve dog wash! If you're not
    sure what a self-serve dog wash is... Let us explain. We provide the
    space, all the supplies, towels, aprons, and high raised tubs that
    save your back. Oh, and did we mention we clean it all up so you
    don't have to! (Kind of like a car wash for dogs) We are currently still looking for the perfect location. Many of
    the chain dog groomers own exclusive rights to providing grooming
    services of any kind, which has slowed us down, but it hasn't
    stopped us! As dog owners who need this service ourselves and
    knowing how much of a time saver it is, we are determined not to let
    big businesses stop us! We will create a family friendly space that
    represents Laveen well. Please help us to raise the capital needed
    to purchase our equipment and open the doors of Scrub-A-Pup! Our goal is to be up and running in November 2016... Please help
    us make our dream come true! Thank you in advance!",https://fundrazr.com/scrubapup
819,Help Luna open a cutting edge boutique on Main St.,U.S. Dollar,,of $3.5k goal,23,23%,"****Scroll to the bottom if you'd rather get right to the financial
  breakdown, or read on if you'd like to know the back story and details
  of what I'm doing.******* In  2009, I  was offered an opportunity to pursue my dream of owning
  a boutique, and opened up in the lower level of a downtown building,
  below Thomas Hammer Coffee. I had no exposure, and people had to walk
  thru a gallery to even find it, but none the less, I was able to say
  I'd done it! I opened an eccelctic little shop called, The Box in the
  Basement. Within a few short months, yet another opportunity arose, to
  move into the suite next door, with slightly more exposure, and be
  part of what was to be known as the 8th St. Micro Mall, where other
  small and budding businesses were given a launch pad, inlcuding
  Bricolage, Sibbz Custom Rides and Dead Bird Gallery. Much to our dismay, after 6 months, we were informed that the man
  opperating the Micro Mall plan had been taking our rent checks, but
  alas.....not paying the rent with them, and we were evicted from the
  suite. Some continued pursuing their dreams, and with success, but
  with the loss of a son, and lack of support on my homefront, my dream
  had come to a halt. NOW...several years later...the universe has litterally laid out the
  real possibility of reviving this dream again, and I can't ignore it.
  I lost my job 2 days after Christmas, and after months of trying to
  figure out how to get by and make something of myself, I had rebranded
  my business, and have been trying ever so desperately to get into the
  groove of online selling, using Etsy. I thought it was as close as I'd
  ever get to having an actual store again. However, on Mother's Day, I
  noticed a ""for lease"" sign in the window of a storefront on
  Main St. that I've daydreamed about for 10 years. Not thinking I could
  ever afford it, it took some urging on my daughters part to call the
  number and inquire about the details. Long story short, too late....the rent is BEYOND affordable (based on
  the small size and awkward layout), but as the property manager wasn't
  interested in renting to me because my lack of recent financials, the
  cupcake business who's needing their lease taken over, has offered to
  sublease to me, allowing me to open up shop again, and only be
  commited to another year and a half of their lease, making this
  incredibly low risk for me to do! I have A TON of my inventory
  still....I still have some store fixtures...all I REALLY need, is the
  money to move in. THIS is where I need YOUR help! ""So, you've rebranded. What's with the new business?"", you
  ask. Trend Forgetter Gallery is a cutting edge boutique featuring a
  curated collection of hip and marketable pre-worn and upcycled
  fashions for men and women, as well as a home for display of artwork
  from new and upcoming ""edgy"" local artists collective. I
  will also host innovative opportunities to showcase music, poetry,
  interviews and whatever else exciting that I think up. Trend Forgetter
  Gallery's mission is to promote that it's not about what all the
  fashion magazines say ""is in"", or about what is
  ""trending"" right now, be it in fashion, music or whatever...
  it's about forgetting about those presets, and bringing out your inner
  YOU, and THAT being what is hip. That is what will make YOU unique. I am applying for a few grants, but funds from this fundraiser are
  for IMMEDIATE NEEDS TO MOVE IN. In a perfect world, I would have AT
  LEAST the amount needed for rent and deposit by the end of May,
  allowing me to move in June 1st, and be open within the last 2 weeks
  of June. Here is what your contribution will cover. -RENT is $750/mo + deposit of equal amount = $1500. I NEED THIS
  AMOUNT ASAP. Honestly...if I even just make this much, I can wing the
  rest, as I'm really resourceful and creative and can make things work
  with what I have/can afford, but I can't do ANYTHING unless I make at
  least this amount. -The Space is small and awkward, leaving me with the strong
  possibility of having to invest in new displays. I will also have
  ALLLL window for a storefront, so mannequins will be needed as well.
  I'm projecting at needing around $700 - $800 (conservatively). -$1000 for advertising and signage (again, conservatively) -$250 for register and labeling supplies https://www.etsy.com/shop/TrendForgetterOnline https://www.facebook.com/TrendForgetterGallery/",https://fundrazr.com/018Ixc
"28,089",Dutchsinse Fundraiser for Seismic Forecasting,U.S. Dollar,,of $35k goal,660,80%,"For the last 7 years, Dutchsinse (Michael Janitch) has provided a
  free daily + weekly seismic forecasting service to the world while
  making many amazing discoveries along the way. This ongoing fundraiser is intended to provide all the necessary
  funding needed for the next year of earthquake / seismic forecasting
  research.  The amount raised will cover all operations costs, and
  salary goals to support a daily world reach across multiple media outlets. In light of multiple recent shutdowns, shutoffs, and blatant
  censorship of the seismic forecasts, this has caused a negative effect
  on the ability for operation costs to be met, thus the creation of
  this fundraiser is necessary. Quite literally, due to my findings being controversial to
  certain government agencies, due to being smeared on CBS news (etc)
  the information is being censored to the point where a fundraiser is
  needed just to meet basic costs of operation, and living. In exchange for this donation option, I will be available each
  day of each week for the foreseeable future to do seismic studies,
  forecasting, and research on controversial geophysics theories. Please help if you can! Anything sent to my operation will help me survive during this severe
  censorship, and help spread earthquake forecasting to the world. MUCH LOVE to everyone who has helped over the past 7 years !  I
  could never have gotten this far without your support. :) =Dutchsinse= Michael Janitch",https://fundrazr.com/f1A7Od
"2,317",Wildlife Food Web Research Project,Canadian Dollar,,of $14k goal,34,17%,"Hi! My name is Christa and  I am currently in Year Four of my PhD at
  the University of Calgary. I am conducting a research project
    on the diet of wolves . In order to answer my research question I am generating chemical food
  webs for different locations in Canada based on what wolves consume
  and what their prey species ingest. These food webs will assist in testing my hypothesis and will determine “if” and by
  “how much” certain types of human disturbance impacts the interaction
  of consumer to resource, that is – Are wolves consuming more prey of one type than another in
      relation to a certain human disturbance on the land? Or-- Are Herbivores (moose and /or caribou) selecting more of a
      particular plant in relation to a certain type of human disturbance? I have collected a large number of plant and animal species  and I am
  measuring the amount of different of naturally occurring chemicals.
  The cost of analysis which is completed at a lab in the USA has
  increased during the time I began this project and the dollar has
  decline. I had planned to run all the samplesI collected and do not
  want to leave out these remaining 300. If you would like to be a part of this research, I am asking
      if you donate by paying for one of the 300 samples which are now
      at $40 USD Any donations will be graciously accepted. I will continue to update weekly as to how many samples have been
  paid for during this fund raising campaign. Thank you for your assistance. Lets see what the internet can do! C. Sample Count: June 3 -- 0 of 300 June 10- 40 out of 300!!! SEE ACTIVITY HIGHLIGHTS BELOW!!",https://fundrazr.com/wolffoodwebproject
100,Helping Nature by helping Heartland Land Creations,U.S. Dollar,,of $25k goal,1,0%,"My name is Joshua Skolnick and I am the sole proprietor of a
    native landscaping and ecological restoration business called Heartland Land Creations . We
    restore rare native landscapes and use local indigenous materials to
    create unique sustainable landscape projects and create a sense of
    place in southeastern Wisconsin and in northern Illinois, Heartland
    Land Creations is one of less than a dozen companies that provide
    this service in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas. This year we have taken on some large clients and thus hoped to
    expand, but due to unforeseen circumstances me, and the company have
    suffered large financial setbacks that have set back our plans for
    expansion. We needed repairs to our home base and I, the owner had
    been in three vehicular accidents, one of which involved the
    businesses’ work truck, which was out of commission for six months
    and cost over $6,000 to repair out of pocket, not to mention
    thousands of dollars in other related expenses and work we could not
    complete or take on due to lack of equipment. As my personal credit
    rating was damaged in the recession, which we have not completely
    recovered from, traditional lending sources such as banks are not a
    viable option for me at this time, so we are looking for help from
    friends and ecological advocates. Heartland Land Creations is very important for two reasons. It
    is our family's main livelihood, and the services we provide are
    unique in that we carefully restore the natural areas and create and
    maintain native landscapes that few others have the knowledge to do
    properly. We have had glowing reviews and referrals by the majority
    of our customers. The photograph on our campaign page shows a ten
    year old prairie restoration done by us which was formerly a
    degraded and ugly thicket of invasive box elder and buckthorn that
    had displaced the prairie that belonged there. Heartland Land Creations business is expanding at this time due
    to the fact many people in my area care about the environment and
    government is doing less and less to protect it. However without
    meeting certain needs the business cannot grow as a one-man
    operation. Furthermore, my daughters, who once helped me with work
    at the business, are now full time college students and have outside
    jobs, and are now unavailable to help. I have tried using local high
    school students as well as supplementary help, but have found them
    unreliable. So the business needs to hire more dependable and
    knowledgeable people, which is impossible given our current
    financial situation. Heartland Land Creations work directly benefits our environment
    by absorbing and filtering the waters before they enter our water
    table, lakes and streams, and protecting rare habitats, over 95
    percent of which have been destroyed in the upper Midwest. Our work
    helps protect and improve our water resources and helps reduce the
    need for fossil fuels, and the infrastructure such as the Dakota
    Access Pipeline that supplies these harmful products. We are trying to increase our sustainability and put our money
    where our mouth is by moving away from gas powered tools where
    possible and replacing/supplementing with battery powered chain saws
    and brush cutters, investigating and utilizing organic ways of
    controlling non-native and invasive species affecting our projects,
    and creating a web site and company logo to increase our public
    outreach. We are also looking to bring on employees so Heartland
    Land Creations can take on more important projects and start giving
    back to the community through such initiatives as public education
    on the benefits of ecological and sustainable landscaping, and
    preserving rare native plants through kick starting a native plant
    nursery, growing plants with little or no commercial availability, At a minimum we will be needing the following to expand our capabilities: Building and maintaining a company web site and advertising in
    local media. We currently market ourselves strictly through our
    Facebook page and word of mouth. Procuring a tool trailer for storage and hauling of tools and
    equipment to work sites and an open trailer for hauling project materials. Procuring several battery-operated power tools such as
    chainsaws, pole saws and weed whips, so we can do site maintenance
    without using gas and oil. This is important to our mission of
    reducing pollution and green house gases generated by our work. Repairing and rust proofing the body and frame of the main work
    truck in order that it lasts longer, thus reducing our environmental impacts. Upgraded computer and printer for home office for company
    records and outreach, Projector for public outreach and
    presentations on sustainable landscaping. Seed money to pay expenses related to upgraded insurance, and
    record keeping/payroll  needed to make it possible to hire 1 to 3
    employees in the short term to cover our increasing work load in our
    core areas of natural areas management work and construction of
    native landscapes and to add additional projects such as a native
    plant nursery, . Seed starting medium and containers for propagating native
    plants. Initially looking to produce at least 5,000 native flowers
    and grasses, and 250 native trees and shrubs for our projects in the
    first year in a purchased or rented green house facility minimum 500
    square feet for propagating plants. We are hoping to reach out to
    local schools and community organizations to become involved with
    this project. We are looking to friends to help fund these things. My wife and
    I have no living family members who can help us move ahead with our
    expansion. Though we are trying to be as frugal as possible, it
    costs real money to do the necessary expansions. The owner cannot do
    all the work himself, even working 80 hours a week, which is not
    unheard of during the busy season. We estimate it will cost around
    $25,000.00 in seed money to fund our short term expansion
    initiatives. Some of the major items: $4,000 buys a tool trailer.
    $500 buys hand tools for a crew of three. $5,000-$8,000 pays for a
    small greenhouse and growing media for plants, or for the rental of
    a small area for several years for growing native plants.  $4,000
    buys the necessary battery powered power tools and hand tools needed
    for a crew of 3 people to do natural areas management, and it will
    cost at least 4,000 for upgraded office equipment, beefed up
    business insurance including workmans compensation, building  a
    website, and the groundwork to take on new employees. Help us get to
    the next level to build a flourishing, sustainable local business
    that brings people and nature together. Thanks so much for your
    help. As we expand, we will keep you posted on what your generous
    contributions have made possible on our Facebook page and website as
    it develops. My family and I thank you for your support Joshua Skolnick. Principal and Owner, Heartland Land Creations",https://fundrazr.com/BuildHeartlandLandCreations

  really big into eSports and the gaming community as a whole. After
  countless days of trying ""Energy Formulas"" nothing really
  hit us, so we got the great idea one day to create our own formula
  that is unlike any of the others, has amazing flavors, comes in 45
  serving tubs and for half of the price than any other brand out there! Gaming is a huge part of our life and basically an everyday task for
  us. So what did we do ? We teamed up with some of the best graphic
  designers out there to help us create the labels and graphics to make
  this business possible! We want to bring our idea to life and create a successful business
  and have fun doing it, we can do that because we know what the
  community needs. We cut out the big costs that is not necessary so the
  gamers who cant afford a true energy formula can actually try it and
  see what all the hype is about! We have a variety of amazing flavors
  for you all to try and we promise to anyone that helps will not be
  left empty handed! All of the money raised in this fundraiser will go to paying the
  designers, building the website, buying all of our tubs, labels and
  etc that we need to make this company possible! Thank you all",https://fundrazr.com/Overdrive
595,Help Grassroots Kind Hearts feed those in need.,Canadian Dollar,,of $45k goal,16,1%,"The Grassroots Kind Hearts Society was founded
      by Krisandra Rufus in April,
  2015 . It started when Rufus' nephew messaged her saying
    he was homeless and hungry. ""So I came down to bring him
      some food and he had all these friends down here and I thought,
      'Well, I can't just feed him, I have to feed everybody - I can't
      see them not eat'"". Over the months, several volunteers joined the group which now
    serves an average of 70 people per evening or more 7 nights per
    week.  With dedication and hard work we also became a BC
    Incorporated Society.  In addition to the home cooked meals, the
    group also gathers (or purchases) seasonal clothing, sleeping
    bags, tents, warm blankets and provides additional supports such as
    'hand-crocheted plastic sleeping mats'. We have also helped over 12 people transition off the streets
    and into treatment - ""We Believe"" is Krisandra's motto! With the money raised through Crowdfunding and other
      fundraising activities we will continue to purchase nutritious
      food to feed and support our Elders, family and friends who live
      on the streets; those at risk of being homeless and those living
      in poverty conditions in Campbell River, BC. We understand that everyone is entitled to a home. We are also
      currently working towards securing a 24/7 facility where we can
      operate out of and grow into providing more resources and
      collaborating with other community organizations. Our goals are simple but we know the difficult challenges we
      have faced in continuing to provide the basics of food and
      advocate for a permanent building for those that often don't have
      a voice.  All our volunteers purchase items out of their own
      pockets often at their own personal hardship. We are now asking that you help Krisandra Rufus and the countless volunteers of the Grassroots Kind Hearts Society continue
      with our vision.  Please also SHARE this crowdfunding campaign and video. Thank YOU.  ""We Believe""",https://www.blackpress4good.com/grassrootskindheartsociety

  yourself, I probably would have told you shopping and traveling my
  life away. Well, amid that five-year mark, at the age of 28 I was in
  for the ride of my life. Finding out your pregnant with your first
  child should be filled with joy and preparation but for me that wasn't
  the case.  Upon test at about 16 weeks along, I found out my unborn
  son had a chromosome deletion that would leave him with a multiple of
  medical issues quickly categorizing him with special needs I couldn't
  wrap my head around.  And at that point all I could think of is, why me? Now we are almost 5 years into this amazing journey together, my son
  and I. Along the way I have discovered that information was grossly
  lacking.  As we proceed to encroach upon new steps in life, the
  process gets harder and harder. Luckily, I don't like partial
  information and I search for me. As I have been putting the pieces
  together, I find that there isn't a resource for those that fall under
  the general umbrella of special needs.  Most programs focus only on
  autism and the awareness of such. I have started a nonprofit, Perfect Piece of the Puzzle, Inc. with
  the hope of helping other families such as myself. I would like to
  understand how and where the lack of information and resources apply
  with them.  I want to be a guide so that we can do better for each
  other.  Giving our children a better chance at life. It is not an easy
  task of supporting your family as well as giving our children the time
  needed to flourish. We would like to help parent(s) with some of the
  financial burden, especially with child care needs. The purpose of this fundraiser is to help me with the last steps of
  making my nonprofit official.  I am a single mom and this means so
  much to me. I see how lucky my son has been and know I can do that and
  much more for so many others. Thank you so much for reading my story.  If you know anyone that has

  and donate if you can afford it.  As little as $5, $10, $20 or more
  can make a huge difference. Some of our more notable success stories just in the past year alone,
  along with over a hundred other verified recoveries and captures
  include: Helping a Wisconsin family discover
    their new roomate is actually a fugitive sex offender from Indiana. 200K Facebook Shares Force Child
    Porn/Rapist Suspect Jeremiah Malfroid's Surrender . The identification and capture of an
    unknown man wanted for filming himself in sexual acts with a
    two-year-old girl. The Identification and Capture of one
    of the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives For Crimes Against
    Children, an unknown man wanted for molesting young girls in several
  states: John Walsh and his new show ""The Hunt"" aired an
  episode about this case. He was not only identified as a direct result
  of this page but also captured because of this page. Johnny Benjamin Napier, was wanted in Montana for molesting a young
  girl, the FBI had photos of him but did not know his real name. I
  made three flyers with those photos: https://www.facebook.com/missingcases/photos/a.347630865257254.81401.212865135400495/697070500313287/ https://www.facebook.com/missingcases/photos/a.347630865257254.81401.212865135400495/689579411062396/ https://www.facebook.com/missingcases/photos/a.347630865257254.81401.212865135400495/695908107096193/ Those flyers generated over 213,000 shares and he was identified
  because of that flyer after a bail bondsman recognized him as a man
  she bailed out in child molesting charges in Texas who had since
  skipped bond. Once I found out he was identified, I reshared the flyer updating
  users to his real name and he was captured days later in Springfield,
  Missouri; by a facebook user who saw the post. On the show John Walsh said an amazing thing happened, someone saw
  that flyer on Facebook (and they showed the actual flyer I created)
  before he even had a chance to profile him on his show and he was
  captured. No disrespect to John Walsh, but he made more in the ads
  that ran during that one hour show than I made since starting this
  cause in 2006. I don't have any advertisers but if I did I would be
  willing to put their logo on my flyers. Until then, I must keep asking
  for donations. 213,000 shares led to his identification and capture. By stark
  comparison, the FBI posted the same exact case on their Facebook
  resulting in only 907 shares and at the time they had FOUR times as
  many followers as me. That tells me a lot, either my system is far
  more superior than theirs and you can judge for yourself by comparing
  the quality of the flyers: https://www.facebook.com/FBI/photos/pb.72092591211.-2207520000.1450460520./10151966725406212/?type=3 OR
  their followers are mostly fake likefarm profiles. Either way, I'm
  getting the job done. What do I do? I create a high quality flyer that can be shared on the
  web or printed as a poster. These flyers do not make themselves and
  creating them and running this website requires an immense amount of
  time. I don't use an app to make my flyers resulting in postage stamp
  sized photos that you cannot even see what the person looks like. I
  make the flyers large enough so that when printing as a poster you can
  still see what the person looks like. Each one is made personally by
  me requiring much time and research. Locatethemissing.com (formerly Missingcases.com and Missing), was the
  true pioneer in implementing the use of social media to aid in finding
  missing and wanted persons starting in 2006 through the use of MySpace . Many well known news organizations such
  as USA Today , KELO , Kennebec Journal and The Daily Dot to name a few, have
  written articles about our efforts and successes. Locatethemissing.com is the largest social media resource in the
  world to help locate missing persons and find wanted fugitives. We
  continue to set records for the high volume of missing persons and
  wanted fugitives located quickly that no other social media presence
  can compare to. Locatethemissing.com is dedicated to effectively utilizing social
  media to locate missing and wanted persons across the United States.
  Nearly a thousand missing persons and wanted fugitives have been
  located quickly since 2006 as a direct result of our collaborative
  effort of simply posting a high quality flyer online to you, our
  massive network of real people. Due to the success of our efforts, this organization has skyrocketed
  in size with volunteers all over America using our social media posts
  to help locate missing and wanted persons. While we are the most
  extensive, far reaching system on social media in existence today for
  the purpose of locating missing and wanted persons, our abilities are
  tremendously hindered by a lack of financial
  resources. Currently two individuals run this organization. While our efforts have been very productive, they have also required
  a great deal of time, some days anywhere from 8 to 16 hours of work.
  Everyone knows time is money. No legit missing persons organization
  runs without funds. These flyers don't make themselves. Each one requires at the very
  minimum one hour to make. I don't just go and copy and paste the first
  news article I find on the flyer. I have to compile info from multiple
  media sources each telling complete different stories, different
  heights, weights, police contact numbers, etc. Then I have to verify
  whether or not the right numbers are being used. I don't just throw
  the 1st tiny blurry drivers license photo I find in a news article. I
  spend time searching for recent photos on facebook, instagram and
  twitter of what the person actually looks like today, not 4 years ago.
  The key to finding someone is having a good recent photo of how they
  actually look now. Then there are other costs for day-to-day operations, such as but not
  limited to: Updating current cases, following up on leads, training
  new admins, developing website based applications, software license
  costs, domain & hosting costs, promoted posts via Facebook
  advertising in select cases, printing and distributing flyers in some
  cases, just to name a few vital costs we need in order function. We make no claim that any donation will be given to any specific
  missing persons family. The funds are soley for Locatethemissing.com
  to continue effectively broadcasting these cases to our network of
  over 2.3 million users on Facebook, Twitter and MySpace. We are not currently a registered 501(c)(3) but are exploring the
  possibility of becoming one (that alone costs several thousand
  dollars) and other means of funding the expansion of our operation
  such as advertising and sponsorship. We cannot continue at such a pace without your help and will be
  forced to limit new posts to only a few a week or less. It's simply

915,Please help Krista pay rent and pursue a dream!,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,10,18%,"Hi friends. I am so lucky to have so many friends to have supported me
    emotionally through the years, through being homeless and some other
    dark things in my past.  I need help again, but just of a different
    sort.  I need your help to follow my heart and my passion.  At some
    point I had an epiphany experience and realized my calling was to
    work with kids (especially those that society misunderstands) and
    nothing makes me feel alive like creating art.  Working with kids,
    and creating art got me through several dark years of being
    homeless, and other tough situations.  Now, I am desperately working
    towards getting my life to a place where I am again pursuing the two
    things that I love. I have been given an opportunity to work at Anishanbe Academy,
    an amazing school focused on Indiginous youth.  If I take this job,
    I will be taking a huge cut in pay and hours.  The silver lining is
    that I could kickstart some of the art business ideas I've been
    dreaming of, but haven't had time for.  Most specifically, I am
    hoping to start a henna business. In order to do this I need time to create and photograph my
    work, to market myself, to create a website and get clients.  It
    will be a little while before this is a viable income. In the meantime, I am care giving for my mom, who is very sick.
     She is so sick that she couldn't handle a move right now, and so I
    pay half her rent every month since I've moved out, so that she can
    stay there (she couldn't afford the place on her own). At some point
    I hope to buy a duplex, and have her move in with me.  This would
    save me so much expense, and I could care for her better if she were
    just upstairs from me. In the meantime, this is what I have to do. We do what we need
    to do for family. Years ago, my mom and I were homeless, and
    incurred a lot of credit card debt staying in hotels (we stayed in
    shelters the first time we were homeless, but were able to stay in
    hotels the second time, which was really a blessing with my mom's
    declining health). While my mom is a wizard with finances and we've
    found a way to pay the initial charges off, we've had to put other
    things on the cards to keep a float.  We are still trying to get
    ahead. I feel trapped in a job that is keeping me from my passions
    and goals because of money.  I need help.  If I could have help
    covering rent and bills for the next 2 months, I could get my henna
    business off the ground, and start sustaining, without having to say
    no to the amazing opportunity at Anishanabe Academy. In turn, I
    could save for a downpayment on a house, and move my mom in with me.
     You have no idea how life changing this would be.  Thank you thank
    you thank you for considering.",https://fundrazr.com/21Gjye
"1,100","""The Rock That Gives Life""",Pound Sterling,,of £1k goal,30,110%,"Throughout the course of 2016, ReefDoctor has been
  hard at work researching and preparing for the construction of the
  first artificial reef in the Bay of Ranobe. But we really need your
  help and generosity to raise the remaining funds needed to expand the
  system, and to care for it for years to come. And here’s why….. ReefDoctor is an NGO located in the Bay of Ranobe in Toliara, the
  poorest region in southwest Madagascar. The majority of the population
  in the area depends on marine resources to sustain their lives, but
  sadly, these resources are limited due to a number of factors
  including reef degradation and over fishing, leaving these people with
  even fewer choices than before. Since its establishment in 2001,
  ReefDoctor has been working with the local community to implement
  projects that assist the recovery of the reefs and, in recent years,
  to provide alternative livelihoods to those reliant on fishing as
  their principle source of nutrition and income. Our new artificial reef project plans to install simple, relatively
  low-cost and replicable artificial reef structures on degraded reef
  sites to increase fish and invertebrate populations in order to
  improve fisheries productivity, reverse declining catches and redirect
  fishing pressure off over-exploited fragile coral reefs in the lagoon
  interior. We also intend to speed up the regeneration of corals reefs
  at these sites by transplanting coral fragments from our nurseries on
  to the artificial structures as part of our coral gardening project. Our pilot artificial reef project aims to construct a reef that will
  attract life to a previously almost deserted area of the traditional
  Anatirano fishing ground. Using 21 tons of limestone rock sourced from
  local quarries and 25 concrete tubes manufactured locally, the team
  consisting of fishermen from the village of Ifaty and ReefDoctor
  staff, interns and volunteers will begin construction of the reef
  following the official launch of the project and blessing of the site
  on 21st October. A huge event will take place in the village of Ifaty on Friday 28th
  October, which will be attended by the Mayor of Belalanda and the
  Minister of Fisheries and the day will include traditional dance,
  songs from the ReefDoctor Juniors and traditional sporting events. We have called this artificial reef, Vato Mahavelo, meaning,
  “the rock that gives life” in Vezo dialect and the aim of the project
  is to do just that. The goal of Vato Mahavelo is to increase marine
  life in the fishing grounds and encourage new reef growth in order to
  provide an alternative productive fishing ground for local fishing
  communities. With your help, the community and ReefDoctor can make
  this a reality. Work on Vato Mahavelo will continue long after construction, with
  regular coral transplanting, cleaning, monitoring and surveying dives.
  The site will be managed by the local fishing association to ensure
  sustainable fishing practices. The community is very dedicated to
  making this project work and many people stand to benefit if Vato
  Mahavelo lives up to it’s name, but we need more than dedication to
  bring life back to the area. We need your generous donations! With your donations and help, Vato Mahavelo can grow into a reef that
  will change and better the lives of the local people for years to
  come. Please consider donating anything you can. In the Bay of Ranobe,
  even the littlest bit can make a world of difference. For more project information, check out our blog: http://www.reefdoctor.org/rock-gives-life/ To sign up to our newsletter please visit: http://www.reefdoctor.org/newsletter/",https://fundrazr.com/artificialreef
100,Help us create jobs for less fortunate people,U.S. Dollar,,of $25k goal,1,0%,"During my travel to countries around the world one of my favorite
  things to do was to go to public markets.  There, I had the pleasure
  of meeting nice people of various walks of life.  The majority of
  these people were generous, friendly and honest in spite of the fact
  that many of them clearly were rather poor and struggling financially.
   Items that the merchants sold to provide for their families included
  beautiful handcrafts.  Obviously, I always ended up buying a few items
  that I brought back home with me.  From time to time, I get comments
  from friends asking where they can purchase such items and I end up
  disappointing them by telling them that they were from so and so
  country and to either wait until I go back there or that they can
  travel there themselves in order to buy them. I always wanted to help others and also to have my own business.  A
  year and a half ago, I found myself without a job due to the collapse
  of the Oil&Gas industry .  Around that same time, I found out that
  my younger brother was diagnosed with lung cancer.  The devastating
  news made me decided to take time off to be with him and his family (a
  wife and 4 young kids).  On August 4th, 2017 my brother died at the
  age of 50; the same date and age as when my father died.  Taking all
  of this into consideration and knowing that the likelihood of one
  finding a suitable job when one is in his/her fifties, I decided to
  start Berichco LLC to be there for my brother's family and to help
  many other struggling families by helping them sell their hand made
  products in North America. I count on you to help me launch Berichco LLC organization.  As a
  token of appreciation, I am pleased to ship to you one of the products
  that we plan to start selling in the near future.  This product is
  Gourmet Nuts Confections which are hand made primarily from high end
  nuts.  Not only they taste great and are healthy, but they are also
  eye appealing pieces of art.  I know it is going to be a struggle to
  put such beautiful pieces in your mouth but that is the only way to
  also enjoy their taste.  SO GO FOR IT YOU CAN ORDER MORE FOR YOU AND

    Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was established in 2014.  Since we opened we've proven
    ourselves to be a successful brewery. We're know of our quirky beer names ie (Crazy Ivan, Socks and
    Sandals IPA, RIIDIPA, Downtown Leroy Brown Porter,...). We're looking to upgrade our small 3bbl system to a large 15bbl What does this mean? It means we have such a high demand for our
    award winning beers that we need to produce more to meet those
    demands. Our old Mash Tun tank Our
  old Fermentation Tank To fix the space we are relocating the
  brewery to a new location so that we can purchase larger equipment and
  put in a tasting room and host various events throughout the year. We need new tanks that we can meet the demand of the beers
    flying off our shelves. The new equipment we are looking to purchase wit the help of fundrazr. Mash Tun 15BBL ( 5 Times larger than our original ) New Fermentation tanks and to upgrade from growlers to cans.  People want cans and we
    want to bring cans to the masses. This also helps us get into
    regulatory outlets such as the L.C.B.O in Ontario and other private
    vendors across Canada & The US. Currently we use Keg's to fill up the growlers and once the
    growlers are poured we begin to lose carbonation and the beers
    eventually go flat. This doesn't seem to happen to us but we cant
    get into the regulatory stores without cans unfortunately. We want to bring new and exciting recipes to the great people

200,Help Us Become Certified USDA Organic and More!,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,3,2%,"Hello! My name is Alex Dupler, I'm one of the founding members of WestWood Organics . Between
  diabetes, obesity, and a whole slew of other diseases, Americans have
  experienced deteriorating health and are falling behind the citizens
  of many other countries. While we recognize there are a myriad of
  causes behind this unfortunate phenomenon, the primary factor is diet.
  Americans as a whole are consuming artificial ingredients like
  high-fructose corn syrup and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
  that negatively affect every aspect of health, but it's not their
  fault! The companies that make these ingredients want to keep people
  in the dark about them, and on top of that, there just aren't a lot of
  organic options for people looking to test it out or make a lifestyle change. Now that you have some background of the problem we are trying to
  tackle, let me tell you our story: During the summer of 2017, my good friend and our founder, Luke West
  ( West ), began making sodas for his own personal
  health. The sodas are unique in the sense that they are created via
  fermentation, the same process kombuchas go through. Kombuchas are a
  popular health-food item that can be found at large supermarkets like
  Kroger, but they haven't infiltrated past health enthusiasts into the
  homes of mainstream America due to their off-putting, vinegar-laden
  flavor. The fermentation process works by supporting a healthy
  bacteria culture within a fruit-based (i.e. raspberry) or root-based
  (i.e. ginger) organic tea. As the process plays out, the healthy
  bacteria packs the sodas with beneficial acids and probiotics that aid
  gut function and give you energy. After Luke started making the sodas
  for himself, he showed our friend Andrew Garwood
  ( Wood ) how to make them and over time, they perfected
  the recipe to the point where the sodas maintained a fantastic, fruity
  flavor all while providing the same health benefits of a kombucha. At
  that point, they realized the sodas filled a market need and could
  also serve a higher purpose to change people's health one small step
  at a time and named their passion WestWood Organics. Looking to
  expand, Luke reached out to his younger brother Chris, myself, and our
  friends Bret Sagasser and Riley VanderKaay. All of us graduated from
  the same high school except Chris, who is in the 11th grade. Riley and
  I are students at Ohio State University, Bret is a student at the
  University of Cincinnati, and Luke and Andrew have taken time off to
  put sweat equity into WestWood Organics. We are currently located in less than 5 independent grocery stores in
  Ohio. Before we expand to bigger independent grocery stores and,
  eventually, larger chains, there is a lot of legal red-tape we have to
  cut through. We have already jumped through many legal hoops between
  becoming an LLC, joining the GS1 barcode association, insuring our
  sodas, and securing a certified kitchen to produce them in, but there
  are still a few things we need to do. First of all, in order to stand
  our ground we must become certified USDA Organic. Beyond that, we have
  to have a laboratory test our drinks to confirm shelf life and
  determine nutrition facts such as calories and macronutrients. We have
  combined our own money along with the revenue generated by supplying a
  few small grocers to help pay for these expenses, but we need your
  help to make it a reality! If you are willing to contribute in any
  way, for any reason, anything helps! Thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/westwoodorganics

    DEVASTATED AND FORCED OUT OF MY FAMILY HOME OF 43 YEARS WHO AM I ? My name is Joan Gadsby and I live in North Vancouver,British
    Columbia Canada and grew up in Southern Ontario. MY BACKGROUND I was in the top 2% of Canadian income earners most of my 5
    decade long successful career in the corporate world working as a
    senior marketing ,strategic planning and property development
    executive with four of Canada's largest companies,as a former
    excluded senior level executive in the BC government and a
    successful entrepreneur running 2 of my own companies, my multi
    family oceanview development Seaview Villa Estates on the Sunshine
    Coast in British Columbia www.seaviewvillaestates.com and my consulting
    company, Market Media International Corporation. I also was a former
    poll topping non partisan North Vancouver District Councillor for 13
    years,part of my extensive years of community service work. Author of an internationally endorsed book ""Addiction By
    Prescription"" - One Woman's Triumph and Fight for Change
    published in 2000 ,I was also Co Executive Producer of a television
    documentary ""Our Pill Epidemic""- the Shocking Story of a
    Society Hooked on Drugs which has aired internationally and
    nationally since 1998. www.addictionbyprescription.com I wrote my awareness driven book, which was one of the
    biggest hits at the Frankfurt Germany Book Fair when it was first
    published, after almost dying February 1,1990 from an unintentional
    overdose of tranquilizers and sleeping pills wrongfully prescribed
    for 18 years by my former trusted family doctor following the death
    of my 4 year old son with a brain tumour.Thank God I survived and
    have been off all those insidious drugs now for 26 years. The continued overprescribing and misprescribing of these
    drugs creates ""accidental addicts "" and remains as a world
    wide systemic problem inspite of my years of work ,extensive
    worlwide research and international speaking engagements in this field. Rebuilding my health,my career and my family cost me
    $2million in lost income and assets in the 1990s following my
    horrendous experience with prescription drugs. Throughout my working career and lifetime I have always been
    committed to being a good Mom, making a good living and making the
    world a better place. At no time going through the past 8 years of hell since the
    global financial crisis and economic meltdown of 2008 have I
    sacrificed the values I was raised with as a child.Nor have I
    compromised my integrity. I have always worked in a ""man's world achieving many
    firsts as a woman after graduating from Western University,London
    Ontario in the 1960s and after being one of the first women in the
    MBA program at the University of British Columbia and being awarded
    a scholarship for the highest marks. I was also nominated as one of Canada's most notable women by
    the Canadian University Women's Club in the 1990s. FINANCIAL DEVASTATION WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY DO I NEED YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT ? Prior to the well recognized global financial crisis and
    economic meltdown of 2008, acknowledged as the worst recession since
    the Great Depression, which I did not create nor could I control, I
    had personally built through years of hard work,perseverance and
    determination , $5.5 million in assets including my North Vancouver
    4 bedroom home in Upper Capilano Highlands on an estate size treed
    and view property where I lived and raised my children, my wealth
    rebuilding project after prescription drugs,my Seaview development
    on British Columbia's Sunshine Coast and the contemporary high end
    show home built as part of Seaview's successful phase 1 of 8
    townhomes built and sold at Seaview's site in 2007. Since 2008 I have gone through 8 years of hell with
    everything I have worked so hard for all my life being seriously
    impacted and challenged including my ongoing income,my well planned
    financial security and financial planning for retirement,my
    lifestyle and sense of well being and my strong belief in social and
    economic justice and human rights here at home in Canada where I was born. My losses and damages since 2008 exceed $6million. All 3 of my properties were foreclosed on and lost through
    the highly dysfunctional British Columbia Court system created by
    ""old boys"" for ""old boys"" after I had fully paid
    back the Royal Bank ,Seaview's phase 1 financing partner its
    $2,588,000 loan from Seaview's phase 1 revenue of $3,362,000 in 2007. Canadian Banks,including the Royal Bank received $114 billion
    in ""bailouts"" through the Canadian government with
    taxpayers' money between 2008 and 2010 since the Banks were
    reportedly ""underwater"" in part to provide continuity in
    financing to successful business people such as myself through
    extreme difficulties associated with accessing capital as a direct
    result of the financial crisis. However,inspite of having paid hundreds of thousands of
    dollars in taxes to the Canadian government throughout my career and
    having created 400 jobs with Seaview's phase 1 which I could do so
    again and could stimulate the economy with each of Seaview's
    remaining 3 planned phases,financing was not available to move
    Seaview forward even though Bank executives referred to my Seaview
    oceanview development as being ""stunning."" I was ""hung out to dry"" and discriminated against
    by the Canadian government who took care of the Banks and their
    executives with my only alternative to take out a mortgage from a
    North Vancouver private secondary lender based on my high equity in
    my home appraised at $1,325,000 which I was reluctant to do to
    invest in Seaview to keep the project moving forward with the
    expectation that the financial crisis would hopefully soon be resolved. The result - the traumatic and ""soul destroying ""
    experience of being forced out of my secure and safe refuge,my home
    of 43 years on April 12,2013 sold to a ""lowball,vulture buyer
    at $876,000 and ""flipped"" 6 weeks later to another buyer
    at $1.1 million.I received no money. Similarly ,in August 2015, the remaining land for Seaview's
    planned next 3 phases of 40 condos was sold to another ""low
    ball, vulture"" buyer for $550,000 compared to the appraised
    market value of the 95% serviced land alone at $1,876,000 and
    appraisal of $3,761,000 for the project as a whole. In approving the lowball sale,the BC Supreme Court Judge
    referred to me as a highly sophisticated business woman and
    flippantly stated that I could rebuild my wealth. An incredible comment given that I was 75 years of age at the time. As Seaview's sole shareholder my investment in Seaview to
    December 31,2014 was $3,026,000 with projected revenue of $18 to $20
    million and projected profit of $6.1 million. My financial survival , future income and livelihood were all
    dependent on completing my Seaview development. All 3 of my properties were lost through the well recognized
    highly dysyfunctional and antiquated court system which ignored (a)
    the deleterious and continuing effects of the global financial
    crisis caused by the greed and dishonesty of financial institutions
    involved with the sub prime mortgage market (reflected in 2 recent
    feature films ""The Wolf of Wall Street "" and ""The Big
    Short "",(b)my allegations of fraud and collusion among
    realtors,lawyers and appraisal companies working for and with ""
    lowball,vulture"" buyers of my home and issues of social and
    economic justice and human rights. WHAT WILL FUNDS RAISED BE USED FOR ? Donations will be used to assist with legal costs for complex
    litigation regarding the forced sale of my home challenging
    fairness,openness, transparency and access to justice enshrined in
    the Canadian Bill of Rights- An Act for the Recognition and
    Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1960 and
    enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 1982 with
    particular reference to ""without discrimination"",'the
    right of the individual to life,liberty,security of the person and
    enjoyment of property"",the right of the individual to equality
    before the law and the protection of the law. "" In addition to naming the Canadian Government and the British
    Government as defendants ,my Notice of Civil Claim includes the
    secondary lender who provided a $174,000 mortgage on my home, its
    lawyer,the private contractor for the BC Government who hired the
    movers who trashed and lost my furnishings and accessories,the
    realtors and appraisal company involved and the agent for and the
    ""vulture"" buyer of my home who ""flipped"" my home
    in 6 weeks. My claim includes discrimination, failure of duty of care,

    damages for loss of equity, damaged and lost furniture,punitive
    damages,special costs and extraordinary costs for reprehensible
    conduct,cruelty, abuse,psychological and emotional trauma. As a result of the high costs of lawyers and of financial
    necessity,I became a self represented litigant in Court for 4 years
    to try and protect my hard earned interests regarding my home and my
    Seaview development .I was described by Judges and Masters as
    ""a person of integrity,hard working and conscientious and not
    ""a shrinking violet."" I have been looking for an experienced and dedicated lawyer
    and law firm to work closely with me on this litigation who is
    knowledgeable of legal principles involved, can research relevant

    support in my fight for justice and to right a serious wrong which
    has left me financially devastated in all respects through no fault

    beta version: http://www.theskyishigh.com Now it is possible to contribute to open-source energy
    technology campaigns. This is just the beginning. Our own ""Enterprise Activation
  Campaign"" is a project by which we plan to raise funds for the
  final stage of website development. We need your assistance. Be a part
  of the movement and help us raise $650 for the activation of the
  Enterprise version of The Sky is High! We are not implementing future competition with our host, the
  excellent Fundrazr, or any other platform. We simply wish to offer
  specialized services to people who require deeper understanding of
  open digital financing in the field of New Energy technologies. An extended version of this platform would enable the public
    to create their own projects. This campaign for has two stretch goals totalling another $400. I
  need your further support for coding and social media extensions.
  Deeper functionality is essential to high standards for maintaining a
  world-class crowdfunding portal in the New Energy sector. I hope that
  by transparently demonstrating completed work I can gain your trust
  that I have the skill and motivation to complete the coding for this
  platform with your financial backing. Over an extended period of time I could finance this myself but
  together we can complete this sooner. I have already spent weeks
  without pay in order to register this business and develop a platform.
  Some of the steps already taken in the development process include: Registration of the business. Creation of a new bank
  account. Creation of a verified Paypal business payment
  gateway. Registration of theskyishigh.com as a
  domain. Installation of WordPress as a Content Management System
  for its global reputation. Purchase of the IgnitionDeck Plugin
  with the shortcodes. Purchase of the Backer WordPress Theme with
  its shortcodes. Initial concept design (reviewed principles, CSS,
  Google Fonts, Colors, Layout…etc) Selection of significant
  content (text, image, video) Debugging Code
  upgrades Creation of initial Campaigns Creation of Publicity
  Videos Creation of Social Media Accounts This is a “Keep It All” campaign (flexible funding) which means I
  keep all the monies received independently of the goal amount and
  timeframe. I believe there are many people out there who can
  contribute a small amount towards the full activation of the platform.
  These contributions can easily total the $650 needed. In this way you
  can also support our family business. This is a 14 day campaign. There are small rewards based on your
  level of contribution. These we will deliver shortly after we reach
  the goal. The expected launch date for the Enerprise version of The
  Sky is High is mid October 2016. Finally, if there are any features you would like to see on this
  crowdfunding platform please let us know. A success in this campaign
  means that we are working together in the New Energy movement. See you in the sky! ENTERPRISE ACTIVATION DETAILS The white-label IgnitionDeck Enterprise solution is a coding
  structure developed by IgnitionDeck, the inventors of self-hosted
  crowdfunding. With the Enterprise version of The Sky is High it
  becomes possible to have a custom front-end registration form that can
  be easily added to our navigation menu so that project creators can
  get started in seconds. It is the only professional grade crowdfunding
  platform for our content management system, backed by a high quality
  support team. Creator profiles are prominently displayed on each project page so
  that backers can learn more about each project creator, a factor which
  increases trust and project marketability. Project designers have the
  choice of fixed funding, flexible funding, or both. The back-end is
  powered by top integrative functionality such as Stripe or PayPal
  among others. Here is a preview of the Enterprise backend for The Sky is High: THE $650 PLUS TWO STRETCH GOALS Enterprise Activation: the main crowdfunding campaign. $650 CAD for the IgnitionDeck Enterprise . The
  activation costs $450 USD but The Sky is High already uses a purchased
  product from IgnitionDeck therefore our Enterprise version is
  discounted at $400 USD, which is $525 CAD. We have added an additional
  25% margin for fees, taxes and the perks we provide. Please see the
  “extensions” list below for the technical details of the upgrade. A
  preview is also available. This campaign for the $650 Enterprise Activation has two stretch goals: First Stretch Goal: coding. $300 CAD for the necessary custom coding of the
  Paypal transaction structure. The Sky is High also requires design
  attention in order to provide the strongest possible support for the
  campaigns. The basic aspects of design which need completion include
  the logo, typography, layout, color scheme, and some aspects of the
  interface (navigation) and interaction (psychological experience). In
  the near future on a seperate campaign we expect to translate the
  platform into polish due to a strong demand, and then into other languages. Second Stretch Goal: publicity for launch. $100 CAD for social media channel programming. The Sky is
  High requires social media content creation and broadcasting in
  preparation for the official launch date. THE EXTENSIONS When The Sky is High activates the Enterprise version, the platform
  will then include new powerful extensions . COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY The following is a list of integrated functionality which will also

  Star Wars: Force Collection (or short ""SWFC""), came back
  with an Android app around two months
  ago. Due to many requests I've gotten about certain features
    and especially an iOS version of the app in the last two
  months, I thought I'll bring the possibility to the community to make all of those happening! Sadly I don't know the programming languages used for an iOS app, so I'll have to hire someone to port the app to iOS for
  me - and that's going to be expensive. 100$ alone is the registration fee to Apple for listing the app in
    the App Store (per year) . To compare: the fee to Google to
  list the app in the Play Market was 25$, once. The hourly wage for a the developer of the iOS version would most
  likely take >30$ per hour . It probably took more than 200 hours for me get the app to this
  point (on Android). Obviously an experienced
  programmer will get to the same stage in much less time. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So I need YOUR help!
    Please support the project by contributing. OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU PURELY DONATED FOR THE IOS VERSION, YOU
      WILL RECEIVE YOUR MONEY BACK IF THE GOAL WILL NOT BE REACHED. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PayPal is definitely working, credit cards should
  work as well, according to the website. Also, please share this site with as many people as possible, thanks! The following list represents the rough goals of this campaign: ~100$ raised: SWFC Stats Line bot (REACHED) So you can receive, for example, a card's stats or the best

245,A Crypto that relies on the Community,U.S. Dollar,,of $125k goal,4,0%,"Since 2014, I have been building the Ultimate Peoples Crypto
    Currency/Blockchain that functions via community involvement and not
    miners or corporations To do this, I need continued support from the community to work on
  new wallet projects that are very expensive and time consuming. Rimbit also needs people who can help us achieve record breaking
  status, which is 100% based on community participation and not
  corporate mining interests! In 2014, we built Rimbit and have been running ever
  since, but we are the Black Duck of the Crypto Community, because we
  are NOT corporate focused and have removed all mining from our system Its functionality is simply based on community involvement and not
  how big your chip is, which the chip is being manufactured by the
  mining industry and sold to miners, keeping it a closed loop that does
  not guarantee any crypto, but the "" chance "" to get crypto! We believe that a currency should run 100% on its own merits and the
  community and not dictated too by media or biased information and that
  a currency that is based 100% on itself, will show a true and
  realistic value, as opposed to by a currency that is ""mined""
  which then throws in many speculations as any crypto coin that is
  ""mined"" will always be at the mercy of a highly specialized
  and very expensive computer chip and how much it can compute.
    T his does not make sense! We also have a Forum, where you can
  discuss things, get help with your wallet and learn more about the
  ecosystem and it is located here: http://www.rimbitforum.net/ 360
    Million Rimbit have been created We are now down to 240 Million Rimbit that is
  available to anyone who would like to try Rimbit for themselves and
  with your donations, we can continue to update the Blockchain wallets
  and even create new methods of using Rimbit on the Blockchain, to make
  Rimbit the easiest crypto to use, that is also uers friendly so anyone
  of any education, country or skill level, can become part of the
  Rimbit ecosystem and make a difference in this world! Rimbit is miner free and is simply delivered by us, with
    donation and funds used to build new projects, improve current
    projects and maintain salaries for those working full-time on the project. When you donate to our campaign, we will send you Rimbit to
    try the system out for yourself. Also, our forum is at http://www.rimbitforum.net/ Our Main site is at https://rimbit.com/ You can get a wallet at https://rimbit.com/wallets/",https://fundrazr.com/Crypto-for-the-people
100,Support Matisse's Start-Up Dream,Euro,,of €2k goal,1,5%,"As many of you close to us know, Matisse has been wanting to
    start his own business in leather accesories and has been putting
    all his time and effort in this, even doing his MA Thesis on this
    entrepreneurial endeavour. Having said so, we are both still students and sadly cannot fund
    all the first steps of this project alone. From our previous
    entrepreneurial project we managed to save some funds but certainly
    not enough to start a proper business. Therefore, I ask for your
    help and support in helping fund his first purchases for this big
    step. Matisse is a hard worker and go-getter that knows what he wants,
    but is unfortunately too shy to ask for help! This is why I ask our
    dearest friends, family, and all those who want to help to please do
    so... this man deserves his dreams to come true. The funds you will donate will go into his first big purchases,
    like a leather sewing machine (He has been sowing all his previous
    products by hand and this is not viable for the long run, especially
    for a big business), a sturdy workbench ( we have a very flimsy one
    that is not standing the test of time), and leather (he is trying to
    go for a more sustainable type of leather that is tanned naturally
    and at a high quality). I would not only be forever thankful for your support, but I
    know Matisse would definitely be super happy to be able to make this
    purchase and go further into his dream of starting this magnificient
    company of his. Thank you a thousand times over for your support! Big hugs, Marifer Aguirre (Matisse's Partner)",https://fundrazr.com/MatisseStardUpDream
"2,363",Food Access In Indiana - Chef Oya Cares!,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,47,24%,"Greetings! I'm Chef Oya. I'm here to request to your assistance in helping me begin to
    bring food access back to Indianapolis. One of my earliest memories is standing on a chair at the
    kitchen sink with my father learning how to peel and devein shrimp.
    I was around the age of 7. From that moment, my love of all things
    culinary began. I've had several jobs in and out of the food service
    industry over the years. From serving to hosting and running a full
    catering business, I know food. Food is my passion, feeding people
    is my love language. In May 2016, I branched out and started decided to start a
    seafood delivery service in my hometown of Indianapolis. I curated a
    menu consisting of ""florida style"" seafood: crab, shrimp,
    lobster and salmon with a delicious house made garlic herb butter sauce. I also enlisted the season-blending expertise of my business
    bestie, award winning blogger and food educator: Candace Boyd Wylie.
    She developed the famed ""YoungBae"" blend and The TRAP was
    born. We've developed a beautifully large base of supporters that come
    back week after week to eat, love and share their experience. For
    that I am truly grateful. For reasons dear to my heart and great for the local economy, I
    decided to use vendors that have locally grown produce. I started
    this business because I'm based in one of the largest food deserts
    in the nation. Because of that, The TRAP is thwarted to be geared: T oward R estoring food A ccess to the P eople. The TRAP has grown by leaps and bounds in a short time. It has
    outgrown its capacity as simply a lunchtime delivery service. It's
    time to grow. I have scouted and found the perfect spot for the
    flagship TRAP location. As stated earlier, being set in the middle of one of the largest
    food deserts in the nation, I am aiming to provide the people in
    this community access to fresh food and produce that is within their
    neighborhood. No one should have to go 6-10 miles to grab a crisp
    apple or a hot meal. That is why the TRAP matters. The location is perfect, but it isn't without its issues. I've
    been able to secure the building. But there are some repairs that
    need to be done. We need signage, painting and the outside space
    needs some love, work and we also need to get some additional
    equipment ie the proper coolers, warmers, shelves and racks needed
    to make our plans come into fruition. I love Indianapolis. I love it's people. I love preparing food
    and I'd love to be able to continue to provide my community with the
    same great level of service that I have been, in addition to
    providing some fresh, new options not otherwise provided. Come through! Dig into your pockets and let’s do this together!
    Any little bit helps. If you can’t help by donating, please help by sharing this with
    all your friends on all your social media sites. <3 I give thanks in advance for everything! Chef Oya ~Trap Goddess~",https://fundrazr.com/ChefOyasTheTRAP

   We have 13 members currently participating at a rate of $50 biweekly.
    The fees for the use of FundRazer is 2.9% plus .30 per transaction
  so that leaves us with approximately $15-$17 fees per payout date
  divided by 12 people so adding 2-3 dollars per payment should cover
  the fees for us.  Also, anything that you would like to contribute
  above and beyond that will go to the many training initiatives that
  ECHO provides. The order of payments is posted in our Private FaceBook group.  As
  the first payment was paid to Monique already there will be 11 pay
  periods in this round.  If we decide to continue after that we will
  randomize the payout.  PLEASE encourage additional people to join as
  this will increase the payout amount and allow more people to save in
  the traditional way of our ancestors. In the event that someone does not make their payment into the pot,
  the pot will be reduced by that payment and that person will be
  suspended from participating in the current round and if a makeup
  payment is not made to the person who was receiving payment that week
  they may be excluded from subsequent rounds as well.  This is a
  savings solution that will be beneficial to all and can grow into
  something beautiful so please honor it. Dates for the first round: January 27 February 10 February 24 March 10 March  24 April 7 April 21 May 5 May 19 June 2 June 16 June 30",https://fundrazr.com/91CTX3

"4,735",Let's help Lucas fulfill his Dream,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,45,32%,"We are American friends of Lucas. Lucas needs to raise
  $15,000 to convert a truck into a Safari-ready vehicle and to launch
  his own Safari Company. Here is his story.. Lucas is a member of the Maasai…the tribe considered the most
  authentic ethnic group of the region. He earned the name “Rasha” when
  he was a boy tending goats with his Uncle in a field. A
  lion attacked and killed his uncle, then chased Lucas. Lucas ran and jumped over a cliff.  He woke up three days later
  in a hospital and learned that he survived because when he was
  falling, his garment got caught on a branch of an acacia tree. Lucas
  suffered extensive injuries and still bears those scars today. His grandpa then called him “Rasha”, The Unbeatable Lion. Today, Lucas lives up to his name, Rasha. Determination, integrity, intelligence, leadership and
  compassion mark the cornerstones of Lucas’ character. These special
  qualities are noticed by many people. In fact, he received a full
  college scholarship as a gift from two volunteers after working with
  him at an orphanage. In 2012, Lucas attended the prestigious Mweka College of African
  Wildlife Management and known for its rigorous curriculum. In fact, Lucas’ Freshman Class began with 80 students, but only
  7 graduated on time. He was one of them. In addition, he graduated
  among the top of his class and received an award for Excellence in
  Fieldwork. Fieldwork has a different definition in Africa versus
    America. In Africa, fieldwork entails not only
  research but a thorough knowledge of survival skills among wild
  animals and very difficult elements. Given very little food and
  equipment, students are dropped off in middle of the Serengeti where
  they must survive alone, using only their skills and a compass, then
  make it back to base in a few days. Fieldwork came very
  easily to Lucas. Having grown up in the “bush” as a
  Maasai, he felt his heart was connected to the environment. As he said, “Botany is my life…if you love the
    environment, the environment will love you back.” Lucas
  has worked for safari companies over the past several years to gain
  business experience.  A Safari trip with Lucas is magical.  He will
  make the vast plains of the Serengeti come alive with interesting
  stories, not only about the animals and plants you see but also about
  habitats, insects, and other things you may not see….How the rare
  tree-climbing lion is only found in Tanzania, or why the huge numbers
  of pink flamingos come to Lake Manyara National Park, or how the
  animals got to the bottom of Ngorongoro Crater Conservation, the
  world’s largest unbroken caldera and home to the large tusker
  elephants. His ability to speak 5 languages allows him to offer
  cultural experiences to clients, such as visiting the Maasai people
  and the Hazbade (bushmen who speak the click language). Lucas conducts
  walking safaris to the Great Rift Valley Wall where you find
  remarkable landscape and endangered flora and fauna.  Or a climbing
  trip for thrill seekers up to the top of Mt Kilimanjaro, the highest
  peak in Africa. Considered a top guide, Safari company
  owners have hired Lucas to train their staff. Lucas has a deep passion for God, his countrymen as well as the
  environment. With his ability to speak many languages and his
  knowledge of remote villages and their people, Lucas offers guide and
  translation services to humanitarian and missionary groups who visit Tanzania. However, even with Lucas’ education and experience, the pay remains
  minimal. To succeed in the Safari business in Africa, one must own
  his/her own truck.  The Tanzanian government makes that option
  extraordinarily difficult due to high taxes, tariffs and fees. The
  cost of new vehicles is prohibitive. Therefore, purchasing a used
  truck and modifying it to become Safari-ready is the common practice

420,MKSpeech: speech based notetaker for the blind,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,5,3%,"English version Introduction Thanks to the improvements in the technology over the last decades it
  is perfectly possible that a blind person can interact with software
  and hardware as any other person does. However, there are some
  situations where a computer is not suitable for everyone, especially
  those who are studying or working, and need a portable device with a
  high battery capacity which could be accessed as fast as possible.
  Some companies created those devices, called notetaker. Basically a
  notetaker is a PDA which allows blind people to take notes everywhere,
  both in a QWERTY or Braille keyboard, and adds a set of customized
  applications for their needs. Notetakers are eazy to use and its
  interface is designed to be easy to understand and access, while
  keeping all functionality that may be useful to a blind person. These
  devices have been used successfully during the last 20 years,
  approximately. However, there is a big problem for most blind
  individuals. These devices are being sold at prohibitive prices,
  starting from $900 up to, approximately, $4000 USD Dollars per device
  or even more, depending on the implemented features. This is the main
  reason why notetakers can only be used in countries where people can
  buy them thanks to governmental support or some other organisations,
  excluding the majority of the blind individuals who don’t have this
  kind of support available in their countries. MKSpeech will be a
  speech powered Note Taker aimed at blind people. The device will be
  built on the top of open source software operating systems, libraries
  and text to speech engines, but will provide support for some
  commercial products too if it can improve the user experience. The
  device will communicate with the user through a text to speech engine,
  that is, a piece of software capable of converting text to speech, and
  the input will be done through a braille or QWERTY keyboard, so it
  will be easy, fast and comfortable for everyone. Who am I? My name is Manuel Cortez, I am a blind software developer from
  Mexico. I have been blind since I was 14, and I have been coding since
  2012 and using Linux since 2009. In 2014, I created TWBlue, an accessible and open source Twitter
  client application; in 2015 I developed two audiogames, Town of peril and Undead Assault (games that rely only on audio,
  aimed at blind people). These projects are available for everyone
  completely free of charge. When I became blind, I noticed that there
  are lots of useful devices aimed at the blind, but unfortunately these
  devices aren't affordable for the majority of the blind people in the
  world due to their prices. With the current technology, I think blind
  people shouldn’t have to pay excessive prices for the same technology
  that everyone else is using every day. I have decided to create
  MKSpeech because I had the opportunity to know how a notetaker works,
  but 90% of the blind people in Mexico, or every other country in Latin
  America, don’t. My goal is that everyone will have the same rights and
  access to the same technology. I think that blind people should be
  able to enjoy the flexibility of these kinds of devices without
  needing to pay more than 500, or even 300, USD dollars. And I think
  the only way to go is open source. Why another notetaker? Price: This device will be sold at $300 or even less, if possible. Language support: It will be possible to translate the notetaker’s
    applications to all available languages by using open source
    software and technology. Updates and support: While I am planning to update and support my
    own software, the base operating system will be Debian GNU/Linux
    (Raspbian) and users will receive system updates and other
    application improvements for years, completely free of charge. When
    released, there will be different channels for getting technical support. Open source: I will write the required software for getting an
    accessible notetaker and will release the source code as open source software. Hardware: The notetaker will be based on the Raspberry Pi Model 3b
    and some additional hardware that is going to be developed for the project. The money will be used for developing the following projects around
  the device: A braille and QWERTY keyboard that will be connected to the PI. A battery that will be powering the entire device, and a module
    that will connect the battery with the Raspberry Pi so it will be
    possible to control the attached battery with a switch, and will be
    possible to get the battery status and get notifications when low
    power from the device. A mini speaker so it will be able to play sound and speech without
    having to use headphones. Every device will integrate a Raspberry Pi model 3B, a micro SD
    card with 16, 32 or 64 GB of storage, and a soundcard that includes
    a built in microphone. I will improve some of the existent open source components in
    order to provide a better user experience, and these improvements
    will be given back to the community. The following accessible applications will be developed for the
    project: A note taking module, contacts manager, File manager, audio
    recorder, ebook reader, audio and video player, interfaces for
    managing different settings in the device, and a system menu. A manual for using the device will be written and included in a
    digital copy and optionally in Braille. You can find more information in the MKSpeech's website . Versión en español Introducción Gracias a los avances en la tecnología durante las últimas décadas es
  perfectamente posible que una persona con discapacidad visual pueda
  interactuar con software y hardware de forma completamente normal. Sin
  embargo, existen algunas situaciones en las que un ordenador no es la
  opción ideal para todos, especialmente aquellos que estudian o
  trabajan, y requieren de un dispositivo portátil con una batería de
  larga duración al que puedan acceder lo más rápido posible. Algunas
  compañías crearon este tipo de dispositivos, llamados anotadores.
  Básicamente un anotador es un PDA (agenda digital portátil) que
  permite a las personas ciegas tomar notas en todo lugar, utilizando un
  teclado QWERTY o Braille, e incluye un grupo de aplicaciones
  especialmente diseñadas para cubrir sus necesidades. Los anotadores
  son fáciles de usar y sus interfaces han sido creadas para ser
  sencillas de entender y acceder, mientras mantienen toda la
  funcionalidad que puede ser útil para una persona ciega. Esta clase de
  dispositivos ha sido aceptada ampliamente durante los últimos 20 años, aproximadamente. Sin embargo, hay un gran problema para la mayoría de las
  personas ciegas. Esta clase de dispositivos se venden a precios
  prohibitivos, iniciando desde los 900 dólares estadounidenses hasta,
  aproximadamente, los 4000 o más, dependiendo de sus características.
  Esta es la razón principal por la que los anotadores solo pueden ser
  utilizados en países en los que las personas ciegas pueden comprarlos
  gracias a apoyos gubernamentales o provenientes de otras
  organizaciones, excluyendo a la mayoría de la población de personas
  ciegas que no cuentan con esta clase de beneficios. MKSpeech será un anotador dirigido a las personas ciegas. El
  dispositivo será construido sobre librerías, motores de texto a voz y
  sistemas operativos de código abierto, pero se proporcionará soporte a
  productos no libres y comerciales, con la finalidad de mejorar la
  experiencia de usuario. El dispositivo se comunicará con el usuario
  mediante un motor de texto a voz, esto es, una tecnología capaz de
  recoger texto y convertirlo en una representación hablada, y la
  entrada de información se realizará a través de un teclado (Braille o
  QWERTY), lo que será fácil, rápido y cómodo tanto para la gente que ha
  aprendido Braille como para quien se sienta más cómodo con un teclado
  de ordenador. ¿Quién soy yo? Mi nombre es Manuel cortéz, y soy un desarrollador de software ciego
  nacido en México. Tengo ceguera desde los 14 años, y he estado
  programando desde 2012 y usando Linux y derivados desde 2009. En el
  año 2014, he creado TWBlue, un cliente de twitter accesible y de código
  abierto; en 2015 he desarrollado dos audiojuegos, Town of Peril y Undead Assault (juegos que solo están basados en
  audio, destinados también a personas ciegas). Estos proyectos se
  encuentran disponibles para todo el mundo de forma completamente
  gratuita. Cuando perdí la vista, me di cuenta que existen muchos
  dispositivos útiles destinados a hacer la vida de las personas ciegas
  mucho más fácil, pero desafortunadamente la mayoría de ellos no es
  asequible debido a sus muy altos precios. Con la tecnología con la que
  contamos en la actualidad, creo que las personas ciegas no deberían
  pagar mucho más por usar la misma clase de tecnología que el resto del
  mundo está utilizando ya. He decidido crear MKSpeech porque yo he
  tenido la oportunidad de conocer cómo funciona un anotador, pero la
  mayoría de las personas ciegas en México, o incluso en muchos otros
  países dentro de américa latina, no. Mi objetivo es que todo el mundo
  tenga los mismos derechos y pueda acceder a la misma tecnología. Creo
  que las personas ciegas deberían poder disfrutar de la flexibilidad
  que este tipo de dispositivos ofrece sin la necesidad de pagar más de
  500, o incluso 300, dólares estadounidenses. Y creo que la única forma
  de lograrlo es a través de software de código abierto. ¿Por qué otro anotador? Precio: este dispositivo se venderá a 300 dólares, incluso menos,
    si es posible. Soporte de idiomas: será posible traducir la interfaz del anotador
    a todo los idiomas que se desee utilizando tecnologías de código
    abierto y estándares de traducción en el software. Actualizaciones: Mientras que planeo mantener actualizadas todas
    las aplicaciones que desarrollaré para este proyecto, el sistema
    operativo principal será Debian GNU/Linux (Raspbian) y los usuarios
    recibirán actualizaciones del sistema operativo y otras aplicaciones
    incluidas por muchos años, de forma completamente gratuita. Cuando
    el dispositivo salga a la venta, se proporcionarán diversos medios
    para solicitar soporte técnico. Código abierto: Escribiré el software que todavía se necesita para
    conseguir un anotador parlante, y lo liberaré bajo código abierto
    para que la comunidad pueda emplearlo de otras maneras, así como
    estudiarlo y mejorarlo. Hardware: el anotador será desarrollado tomando como base una
    Raspberry Pi model 3, y nuevo hardware se diseñará específicamente
    para el dispositivo. Los fondos recaudados se emplearán para desarrollar los siguientes proyectos: Un teclado braille y otro QWERTY, que se podrán conectar al anotador. Una batería para proporcionar energía al dispositivo, y un módulo
    que facilitará la conexión de dicha batería con la Raspberry Pi, lo
    que permitirá controlar la batería con un interruptor, y recibir
    notificaciones cuando hay poca batería en el dispositivo. Un altavoz, lo que permitirá utilizar el dispositivo sin la
    necesidad de utilizar auriculares. Cada dispositivo incluirá una Raspberry Pi Model 3, una tarjeta
    Micro SD de 16, 32 o 64 GB y una tarjeta de sonido que incluye un
    micrófono integrado. Se mejorarán algunas herramientas de código abierto ya existentes
    a fin de mejorar la experiencia de usuarios de lectores de pantalla,
    y dichas mejoras se liberarán a toda la comunidad. Las siguientes aplicaciones accesibles se desarrollarán para el
    proyecto: un módulo para tomar notas, administrador de contactos,
    gestor de archivos, grabador de audio, lector de libros, reproductor
    de video y música, interfaces para configurar el dispositivo, y un
    menú principal para el sistema. Un manual para utilizar el dispositivo se escribirá en versión
    digital y -opcionalmente, en Braille. Puedes encontrar más información en la página

"11,005",Making Campton's Cider Orchards Grow,Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,68,110%,"Campton's Cider Orchards will be something new, by being something
  very old - an orchard that grows fruit just for making cider. After many years of planning, learning, and searching, John and
  Maddie Wernham have finally bought themselves a farm where this
  orchard can be planted! However, buying the farm has taken everything
  we've got, with precious little left over to turn that farm into an
  actual working farm. That's where you come in... But why? Well, for many years, ""the family farm"" has been
  on the decline in Canada. In many ways, this concentrates agriculture
  and food production under the control of international corporations
  that don't have a strong connection to the land. While there are
  incredible efficiencies to production on such a massive scale,
  something gets lost along the way. Food is only as healthy as the land
  that produces it. Campton's Cider Orchards will be different from most modern
  orchards. Instead of focusing on extracting as much fruit as possible
  per acre of land, the orchard will be grown in a way that is socially
  and environmentally responsible. What does that mean? It
  means...supporting natural insect predators to keep pests in check;
  planting the trees with more spacing to allow drying breezes to move
  down the rows and protect against tree diseases; diversifying the
  understory by planting herbs and flowers amongst the trees to support
  healthy bee populations year-round; maintaining nesting habitat for
  hawks and owls to encourage natural rodent control and protect the
  trees. This also means that Campton's Cider Orchards could produce
  less fruit than conventional orchards, but that loss is more than
  offset by the value of the increased health of the orchard and
  surrounding environment. What is needed now is the means to convert the existing hayfield on
  the farm into an orchard. This includes the equipment for cultivating
  cover crops to increase the organic content of the soil, many pounds
  of seed for the companion herbs and flowers that will support healthy
  bees throughout the year, a row mulcher for laying loads of mulch to
  reduce the grass competition for the young trees during their
  establishment years (without using herbicides), and the equipment
  necessary for pruning and harvesting the trees to actually realize the
  fruits of all the labour! And what's up with the name? Why would the Wernham family go with
  ""Campton's Cider""? Shortly after we met, I first encountered
  my wife's grandfather, Bob Campton. He got me started on craft beer,
  which then led me to craft cider, and he's been tremendously
  supportive over the years. Because of his significance in our lives,
  along with the fact that his family name won't otherwise be carried on
  to the next generation, one of our goals is to establish a fitting
  legacy for Grandpa Campton, a gentle soul and thoroughly decent person
  who ought to be remembered. Many of us appreciate that the current path of our food production
  could lead to some major problems down the road, but it also seems
  like there's very little any of us can do to change it for the better.
  Well, why not make a contribution to help one family plant an orchard
  that's better for the environment and better for people?",https://fundrazr.com/41Lfr5
100,We're Bringing The Night Sky To Your Back Yard,Canadian Dollar,,of $50k goal,1,0%,"Greetings, and thank you for taking the time to read our proposal. We
  welcome any questions or feedback, so please feel free to leave a comment. THE COMPANY: We are Maker-Tech Industries, a home-based custom
  prototyping and fabrication company located in Windsor, Ontario
  Canada. Founded in 2016, our goal was simple- We wanted to help other
  inventors turn their ideas into marketable products, which they can
  have manufactured. As we moved forward, we found that there was more
  value in bringing our own ideas to the drawing board. Since the
  company consists only of the three partners- one of whom is a retired
  Canadian Forces Veteran -and we all work full time jobs, it has been a
  challenge to effectively communicate with each other, or collaborate
  on projects. We currently have a few projects in the works however.
  Some still in the design phase, others ready to move on to the build
  phase of the prototype. The project we are introducing today, falls
  into the latter category. THE PROBLEM: We have spent a great deal of time and energy (not to
  mention money) doing research on telescopes- specifically Newtonian
  Reflectors –and we have studied the advantages, and drawbacks of this
  design, as well as how it ranks against other scope designs. Our results were mixed, as the Newtonian offers more
  overall bang for the buck per inch of aperture, compared to a
  refractor, or Cassegrain telescope. Though it did have a few drawbacks
  we were intent on exploring further, to see if we could improve on them. Here is a basic description of how a Newtonian
  telescope works. (Image taken from Google) We examined this design further, and focused (no pun
  intended) on the intended uses for a scope such as this. Would the
  customer be using this for standard viewing, or for astrophotography? The reason we asked ourselves this, is because in our
  research we discovered that this particular design is not very
  adaptable for both. Most newts (Newtonians) are great for standard
  viewing of the night sky, and with perfect alignment, or “Collimation”
  some planets and deep sky objects, such as Galaxies, and Nebulae, can
  be quite spectacular to view through one of these telescopes. Here’s the down side. If you are an Astrophotography
  enthusiast, a newt is probably not on your list of recommended
  equipment. The reason for this, is because the FOCAL POINT of the
  light, or what is known as “Prime Focus” in astrophotography, is too
  far back in the focuser tube for the camera to produce a clear picture. Let me elaborate further… As noted in the diagram above, when the light reflects
  off of the secondary mirror toward the eyepiece, it comes to a point
  inside the focuser tube. This is called the Focal Plane, or Prime
  Focus. For astrophotography, the camera (usually a DSLR) is used
  without any lenses because the Image Sensor inside does all the work
  (see picture below). Stock photo of a DSLR camera with no lens. The rectangle in the
    center is the Image Sensor. In order to produce a clear image, the
    image sensor must be at Prime Focus. The problem is that with the T-ring and adapter
  required to mount a camera, the Prime Focus is just too far away from
  the Image Sensor to receive a clear image. If we look at the diagram
  below, the prime focus ( f ) is right around the bottom
  of the focuser tube. Mounting a camera for astrophotography would be a
  futile effort All hope is not lost, however. If you really want to
  take stunning astrophotography pics with a newt, there are some that
  are specifically designed for this purpose…. But hold on to your
  cheque book, because they are not only more expensive, but also few
  and far between. And did I also mention that they are ONLY designed
  for astrophotography? So if you just want to look through it one
  night, you will probably have to buy more accessories to make that possible. THE EXPERIMENT: We have come up with a few different designs, which
  would allow a user to SWITCH from standard viewing to
  astrophotography- or vise-versa - using the same scope, with a simple
  adjustment, and without losing its collimation. Our goal now, is to
  test each design for attributes like durability, rigidity, ease of
  use, and most important, accuracy. Our designs are all based on one principal; by
  enabling the primary mirror cell to be moved forward in the Optical
  Tube Assembly and using a slightly larger secondary mirror, we would
  essentially be pushing the focal point, or Prime Focus further out,
  toward the end of the focuser. Think of it like water in a straw, only the straw is a
  telescope, and the water is light. When you push it forward at one
  end, it naturally pushes forward at the other. Therefore, if the
  tailgate and primary mirror cell were adjustable forward and back, the
  scope could easily, and effortlessly be switched between standard
  observing, and astrophotography. THE RESULT: The most important factor in this project is accuracy.
  If the scope has to be re-collimated every time it is adjusted, well
  that takes quite a bit away from the ease of use factor. We have to
  ensure that every time the mirror is adjusted, the collimation will
  remain the same. The details of our designs for this project are not
  yet available for patent reasons, and also because we feel that
  testing each design thoroughly will help us narrow the field before
  the designs are released. The image below (taken from Google) describes where
  the focal plane, or Prime Focus would be in a newt designed
  specifically for astrophotography. Notice how the light converges much
  further up the focuser's draw tube, where the camera is able to pick
  up a clear image. With regard to the scope itself, it will look and
  function exactly the same (or cooler) as any other high end newt, but
  with the added functionality of our Focus Adjustable Tailgate. One of
  the other traits this scope will not share with other high end
  astro-newts, is the price. We have sourced only high grade materials, and
  components through various distributors across Canada. Because we will
  be building the scopes ourselves, and scrutinizing every single
  detail, we can guarantee the quality and craftsmanship of our products
  will be top shelf, and 100% made in Canada but without an astronomical
  price tag. THE PROPOSAL: We are looking to raise $50,000 in funding for
  materials, components, and working capital. From these funds, we will
  be building three different styles of our design, and testing each one
  extensively to ensure they exceed the expectations we have of our
  intended result. We will also be allocating a modest portion of this
  funding toward advertising of our products once they are ready. Our goal in this project, is to produce a high end
  product line, featuring a revolutionary design, for the new
  astronomers, and the most discerning enthusiasts alike, and without
  the astronomical price. With your help, and the help of others, we can
  help bring the night sky closer to our own back yard.",https://fundrazr.com/X-EyeStarVision
835,Help a small biz to next step: alleviating poverty,Canadian Dollar,,of $20k goal,9,4%,"Hi friends. I’m Cameron. I’m a regular guy trying to make my way in
  the world like everyone, but I have the tiny additional challenge of
  being deaf in a hearing world. The challenge is not with regards to my
  capabilities – I can do anything anyone else can do except hear.
  Rather, the challenges I mostly face are the preconceptions that
  others have about me and my abilities. It’s normal I guess, but it
  routinely provides unnecessary roadblocks, such as getting a
  meaningful job. In fact, a June 3rd interview with CBC’s The Sunday Edition radio program just interviewed the Executive Director of the Canadian
  Association of the Deaf on this very subject. Michael Enright, the
  interviewer, began with this: “For the past few years, the national unemployment rate in Canada has
  been hovering at around six or seven per cent. But for one segment of
  the population, deaf Canadians, it is 40 per cent, and it has been at
  that level for several decades. Four out of every ten Canadians who
  cannot hear want to work, but no one will hire them.” If you’re interested, you can listen to the whole interview and/or
  read the transcript here . Step-By-Step Successes Because I feel capable and motivated to earn a living wage, I started
  my own lawn care business a couple of years ago called Trust
  Landscaping (TLS). It’s seasonal and I’m at the mercy of the weather,
  but I love working outside in a natural environment and I love turning
  the shabby into the beautiful. Imagine leaving for work in the morning from this: And
  coming home to this: Now that’s satisfying. My plan was to build up the TLS clientele to the point where I could
  hire on teams of workers, including but not limited to members of the
  deaf community who also are not interested in a future of a government
  assisted standard of living. Naturally, beautifying the landscape
  while improving people’s quality of life through honest, well-paid
  employment is a decent enough goal, but it provides a much deeper
  sense of satisfaction for me to enable those whose struggle I have
  also lived and breathed. It’s also important to me to serve as a role
  model for today’s deaf children. They need to see people “like them”
  in leadership roles to which they can aspire in their own meaningful ways. It’s an all-round winning model if I can turn this one-man-show into
  a means to get an ongoing stream of people, over time, off welfare and
  out from under the ‘disability’ umbrella. First goal post, check. Now the road block. Now that I’ve built up a customer base for TLS, I am ready to hire on
  some willing and able-bodied labourers. However, for that I need more
  equipment – as you can imagine, the business has outgrown my little
  Honda and trailer (see below). TLS needs two more work vehicles
  for two new crews, and of course more tools (lawnmowers, hedge
  trimmers, etc.) for them to use. There will also be associated
  business costs to begin with, such as commercial insurances, and front
  pay to workers (clients take longer to pay than the TLS weekly payroll
  would require), etc. Banks
  have either turned me down for loans due to the seasonal nature of
  TLS, or offered exuberant interest rates. That is why I’ve created
  this fundraising campaign – I’m hoping to raise a minimum of $20,000,
  hopefully before July, for equipment for crews to get to work in the
  season that has just started. I know that sounds like a lot, but safe,
  good-quality second hand vehicles in Ontario are not cheap. I worked
  for a company in the past that scrimped on work vehicles and their
  maintenance. I remember the daily anxiety of driving those crappy
  trucks and wondering why my boss found my life so expendable. I want
  better than that for TLS workers. I hope you find my goal worthy and would consider contributing any
  amount towards it – even five-dollar donations will add up. I would
  also be very grateful if you would share this with your social
  media friends far and wide. Summer is coming! Thank you so much.",https://fundrazr.com/a1MYpf
"2,015",Please Help Start a Coffeehouse Ministry near OU,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,3,2%,"We are Josh and Ashley Cole, currently living in Yukon, OK.  Josh has
  served in ministry since 2003 when he began college at Southern
  Nazarene University.  It was a few years later, however, that a vision
  began to form. Josh and Ashley discussed throughout the years a non-traditional type
  of church, one that people might frequent in their day-to-day lives. 
  What type of setting might foster relationships between individuals
  and connections within a community outside of the traditional church? 
  A comfortable, inviting coffeehouse can both support ministry
  financially AND provide that setting.  Especially for the Millennial generations*. We are in the planning and fundraising stage of this vision that God
  has laid upon our hearts.  Funds raised will go towards training in
  the coffee business (including barista training for both of us), fees
  for consulting with a successful coffeehouse owner, securing and
  renovating a location near OU campus, purchasing equipment, and
  operating costs for the first 6 months. Statistics show that coffeehouse businesses typically operate for 14
  months before breaking even and becoming profitable.  We are firm
  believers, however, that ""If it's God's Will, it's God's
  bill.""  Is God laying on your heart to give and to plant a seed
  in this ministry?  Will you partner with us in reaching the
  unchurched, among them the 96% of millennials* who don't attend
  church?  Please pray and ask God how He wants to use you in making His
  vision a reality. *To learn more about the future of the church visit: https://www.barna.com/category/millennials-generations/",https://fundrazr.com/coffeeministry

  father died 7 years ago, he has been working on a day-to-day basis
  finding temporary work as he is able.  Often, he has to pray the
  prayer from Matthew 6:11: “Give us this day our daily bread.” I cannot imagine being in a situation where I didn’t know if I would
  have food to eat day by day.  And so, God has placed it on my heart to
  help Saul by creating a fundraising page for him on fundrazr.com SAUL’S FARM: With earlier gifts from donors, Saul
  began a Passion Fruit Farm on his family land.  He
  has an immediate need for funds ($650.00) to build a
  fence to keep the neighbor’s cows out of his field so they won’t
  damage his plants.  13 donors at $50 or perhaps 26 donors who could
  give $25 each would meet this need. FUTURE FARM EXPANSION : Saul has a dream for future
  farm expansion with a layer chicken egg farm .  Before

  took a side trip to Lalibela.  While there we met a young gentleman by
  the name of Wubet Wagnew who has part time work in the hospitality

  at 22 he is the oldest son and only breadwinner in his family.   After
  coming back to Canada I stayed in contact with him as I had suggested
  to him that he think of going back to school to further his
  education.  He let me know that he had been unable to pass the

  largest single repository of fresh water and a UNESCO World Heritage
  Site, few are aware that its principal source, the Selenge River, is
  under siege from numerous threats. And
  these are not limited to the usual suspects—such as drought, human
  migration, and unregulated mining. Instead, the river has become a
  veritable hostage of global geopolitics, a victim of Mongolia’s
  legitimate desire for energy independence from Russia and China’s
  ravenous One Belt–One Road Initiative. Despite
  the potential harm to fragile ecosystems and nomadic herding
  communities, multiple hydropower dams have been proposed on the
  Selenge and its tributaries. Though these projects are nominally on
  hold, they retain the support of many powerful interests. Meanwhile,
  China’s urban planners continue to tout the feasibility of other
  environmentally indefensible projects, including a 1000-km pipeline
  from Baikal to Gansu Province, completely spanning Mongolia from north
  to south. This
  2018 expedition from the headwaters of the Selenge to Lake Baikal,
  traveling for eight weeks in non-motorized boats, will collect

160,Please help me tell  people they are deeply loved.,Canadian Dollar,,of $30k goal,4,1%,"Help Get An Important Message Out To Spiritual Seekers Like You This is a wonderful universe, set up so that we humans
    could evolve to understand it. We now have a very special
    place within it! About 4% of all humans now living would like to live more
  Love-focused lives, but 85% of humans don’t even believe that there is
  any Truth in the universe. In addition, there are 11% who are trying
  to evolve through the several hope-producing stages of at least living
  in evolving Logic. None of these are helpful in having us leave the
  existential Fear of the rest of humanity behind. For you to live in
  Love requires that you relinquish a Fear-base and start to fully live
  with a Love-focus. The ways of perceiving our universe, as well as our
  place within it, are very different once you step into that process of
  focusing upon Love. I have spent just under two decades learning about all of the above
  and writing a string of books as I learned each further step along my
  journey. Once a teacher has learned a new thing, those who follow that
  leader find it both easier to learn, and can do the learning more
  quickly than the teacher/leader did. Although there is more I would
  like to learn, I believe that it is now time for me to put most of my
  efforts into bring what I have learned to the attention of those like
  you who are discovering that you really do want to live a more
  Love-focused life. Have you been effectively told that you are Destined to become Love
  Incarnate, a living example of Love? That is a Truth of humans and
  this universe. Have you been told that this universe is uniquely set
  up to have species such as humans evolve; then start to investigate
  their possible Destinies? Most likely not! It is much more likely that you have been told (by those who do not
  understand how little that they know) that this is a random universe
  and that you are just an accidental, purposeless outcome of it.
  Reality could not be further from that badly-formed viewpoint. Ongoing
  Science at several levels, and Philosophy as well, indicate that we
  humans are here on purpose and that we are very special indeed, as is
  this universe of ours! Because of the volumes of nonsense out there,
  many will find it both easier and more efficient to learn from what I
  have written, and even from other things that I am already drafting,
  rather than trying to go it alone. What I need, in the short-term, is to assemble enough funding to
  engage others (where I am inefficient or as yet untrained), and
  provide a comfortable environment for my learning and developing how
  to do better marketing. That is what this FundRazr project is all about. When my books are much better known, and I am out and about talking
  about them, or teaching their essential messages, I am sure that you
  will be very proud to have helped this great and hopeful message

  ago, I looked at it and thought ""this would be cool if this was
  HUGE"". She could frame it and keep it forever!  And BIG JUMBO
  CARDS came into play. 80% of consumers purchase the standard 8 x 11 card and that's
  OK. BIG  JUMBO CARDS is simply taking it... LIFE SIZE! All
  of our PosterCards  are""24 x 18"" in size. Sturdy 12pt thick
  cardstock, Full Color, Sign-able and Frame-able Cards! Great souvenirs We will  specialize in: ​Christmas / Holidays Valentine's / Sweetest Day Mother's Day / Father's Day Everyday Birthdays (Biggest

  We ship! Cards are delivered in a secured Safety-Flat company envelope. HIRING / JOB PLACEMENT: @BIG JUMBO CARDS, All cards are designed by our graphic staff
  & team. Nothing out sourced. Nothing copied from ready-made
  posters. This creative flow, will enable our business to open it's
  doors to the ""Creative Minds"" seeking a chance to express
  their talents, all while earning a steady paycheck. Instead of partnering with Amazon / ebay Shipping or any other

  print ""Special PosterCards"" for the ""fundraiser"",
  giving them a better edge of selling out at their event. EX:  If this is a fundraiser for let's say...""Cancer
  Awareness""...we would create ""Cancer Awareness""
  PosterCards.  We wouldn't want to see the organization selling
  ""Mother's Day PosterCards"" for a Cancer Awareness event. We
  will assist in their creative tactics and help the  event to be a success. STAYING IN THE  MARKET: Greeting cards is an estimated $7 Billion Dollar industry.  Via

840,Magnetic Field Observatory,U.S. Dollar,,of $9k goal,18,9%,"My name is Michael and I am an avid space and space weather
  enthusiast. I've grown over the years to love science and have a
  thirst for knowledge that I just can't quench. I believe it is time, as a grass roots community of people who are
  sincerely interested in the overall well being of thier one and only
  home, planet earth, to become more proactive in monitoring important
  aspects of earth that are absolutely critical to everyone and every
  living and non-living creature here on the planet. Instead of always being told through a few main web venues about the
  condition and/or current state of the Earth's magnetic shields, I want
  to build a small, humble facilty (out-building,monitors,antennas) to
  monitor our earth shields, including the Ionosphere using an
  instrument console I may be able to obtain from Stanford University
  that will read the data,  and the antenna I am perfectly capable of
  constructing myself, a large very efficient one, that will detect the
  data and any SID's or ""Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances"". I can build most of the components for this project, some I will have
  to outsource. Depending on the complexity of the magnetic field
  monitoring console, I may need to outsource that as well to ensure our
  data is indeed accurate. The price for that alone is $5600. The
  out-building should easily be under $2000, however it will need power
  and I will need to contract a certified electrician to run a grounded
  110 power supply from the house main to the observatory. I may also
  need a server and possibly a unique internet ID for this observatory
  equipment as I want it available for everyone to see at anytime, 24
  hours a day. I also would like to install a webcam inside the
  observatory that too wil be online perpetually. I may also need to
  hire a programmer to assist me in the configuration of consoles. The
  environment must be sanitary of any man-made interference and the
  building must be free of any ferromagnetic constuction  parts. Its all in the early infancy stages and could cost less, maybe more
  but doubtful. I am very grateful for your time and consideration
  towards this project and making it a reality. Kind Regards, Michael",https://fundrazr.com/f184a3
350,Help Challenger X become a reality!,Canadian Dollar,,of $200k goal,6,0%,"My name is Candace, I want to tell you a little about my story. I
  recently had some huge changes in my life. I made a choice, a big,
  scary, intimidating choice. Six years ago I left an abusive husband.
  It was one of the scariest things I ever had to do. I packed up my 3
  kids, left and rebuilt our lives. I was unhealthy, both physically and
  mentally. With help, I worked hard and managed to overcome my
  depression and maintain it medication free. Physical activity became a
  big part of my life and of my recovery. I am a single mom of 3 amazing kids. I spent time working on myself,
  my divorce and helping my children transition into the new life we
  were creating together. Once all my kids were in school I decided it
  was time for me to do the same. I applied and was accepted to Mohawk
  College. Two years later, I graduated, with honours, form the Health,
  Wellness and Fitness program. As part of that program we had to design
  a business in our field for the final project. From that, the idea of
  Challenger X was born. The project and the concept was ranked in the
  top 5 best of the class and placed second at the end-of-year pitch
  competition, called Fit-to-Pitch. Since graduation I have been working on the business and acquiring
  the necessary certifications and education to bring Challenger X to
  life. This project has become my life and my dream. Challenger X is an indoor obstacle course for individuals looking to
  go far beyond the traditional gym experience. We have developed an
  electronically timed indoor obstacle course and training centre using
  wearable technology that revolutionizes personal fitness on a micro level. There is currently no facility in the Hamilton area that offers
  obstacles similar to those one would come across in an outdoor
  obstacle race. Challenger X provides and innovative and original
  approach to fitness development. Clients can challenge the obstacle
  course, attend group classes and/or purchase personal training. The
  time it takes a client to complete the course itself is used to test
  the client's current fitness level and helps design a personal plan
  for that client to reach their fitness goals. The client is given
  immediate feedback to their account where they can log on to their
  dashboard, either on our website or the smartphone app, to see their
  results and compare it to past results on the course. Challenger X
  offers a personalized, empowering fitness experience like no other in Hamilton. To make this dream a reality I need your help to build up capital.
  Anything you can contribute would be a tremendous help. I believe in
  this idea. I believe that Hamilton needs a facility like this one. I
  believe in who I am and in my abilities. I believe that every day I am
  working towards the greatest version of myself and I am leading by
  example. Showing people that change is not to be feared, that growth
  can only happen through change. I am helping people play a little
  outside their comfort zone, it’s ok to be scared, it’s ok to be
  uncomfortable. Most of my best experiences in life happened just on
  the other side of fear.",https://fundrazr.com/01JTEf

750,"""Marveilleux Lotions"" Incentive Campaign",U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,5,15%,"I CONFESS:  PRAGMATIC VANITY GOT ME INTO THIS! It all started out last year; having recovered from a major health
  challenge, I knew I would have to go back to work.  Can't make it on
  just Social Security.  Also knew that my chances of getting hired
  would be better if I didn't look like death warmed over.  Nothing can
  make me a ""pretty boy"", but at least I could LOOK healthy!  
  Like I said; VANITY. Checking out the many lotions & potions on the market, I realized
  that most were a witches brew of chemicals.  Since I'd become careful
  about what I put IN and ON my body, I looked in vain for something
  truly natural.  Realized I could do better, I researched, formulated
  and with the help of friends, tested various combinations of
  ingredients KNOWN to nourish the skin and possessing strong Anti-Aging
  properties.  Ended up with ""AGELESS"", a skin care lotion
  that is around 95% organic, plus clays & minerals. Having for many years reached out a helping hand to others, I can
  tell you how rewarding that is.  Yet, I am a believer in creating
  WIN/WIN situations, so I have included a number of incentives so that
  this can be a benefit to everyone who participates. Thank you in advance for your generous support! Joe Ps:  I will be asking my product testers to comment in the days ahead
  regarding their experiences with Marveilleux's AGELESS lotion. JJ ONE PROBLEM WE ALL FACE: Looking at the market for personal care products, you will notice
  that even skin care products costing hundreds of dollars are Creations
  from a test tube in a Chemist's lab. While science has come up with some amazing products, which I am not
  averse to using, like many people I have grown increasingly wary of
  all the chemicals in our modern environment.  Studies are showing that
  even small amounts of toxins can have detrimental effects on the human
  body. This is especially true in the area of skin care, since you
  apply it directly on your skin, where it can easily be absorbed. Yet you can spend $200 or more on a skin care lotion or serum and
  find most all the ingredients impossible to pronounce, puzzling as to
  their purpose and questionable as to their effect on the human body. 
  One factor is cost; it is EXPENSIVE to create a lotion that maximizes
  the Natural and minimizes the Artificial. ONE SOLUTION YOU CAN SUPPORT: After many months of research, formulating and testing, reformulating
  and re-testing and reformulating and re-testing (you get the picture)
  I finally created a lotion that my friends who have volunteered as
  testers have uniformly felt was truly Marvelous.  Hence the name:
  Marveilleux Lotions (French for 'marvelous'). It also met my goal of being healthy, nourishing, natural and UNDER
  one hundred dollars ($100.00). WHAT MAKES MARVEILLEUX LOTIONS UNIQUE? You may be wondering, ""What makes Marveilleux's AGELESS Lotion
  (our Flagship product) so special that I should help launch it?"" 
  Here is the List of Ingredients that comes with every bottle: 1. Swiss Apple Stem Cell extract (Uttwiler Spätlauber) diminishes
  fine lines and skin imperfections. Studies indicate it stimulates the
  body’s own production of new skin stem cells and rejuvenates the skins appearance. 2. Frankincense (Boswellia Serrata carterii) extract acts as an
  anti-inflammatory and reduces photo-aging of the skin. 3. Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis miller) has anti-bacterial, anti-viral
  and anti-inflammatory properties. It is soothing and moisturizing,
  contributes to a gradual reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, fights
  off free radicals, promotes the healing of many skin conditions. 4. Phosphatidylcholine from Sunflower lecithin creates smoother
  skin, increases skin moisture levels, supports skin regeneration, and
  enables nutrients to penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin. 5. Oat Beta Glucan (Avena sativa) has been shown to penetrate deeply
  into the tissues to deliver advanced topical skin benefits, healing
  damaged tissues and reducing sun damage. 6. DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol) acts by flushing lipofuscin, a
  cellular waste product, out from the tissue. Another age-defying
  effect of DMAE is its skin tightening action that slows down the
  inevitable natural sagging of the skin. 7. MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane) helps detox the cells, which can
  normalize collagen formation and radically improve skin health. 8. Vitamin B3 fights blemishes, wrinkles and improves elasticity,
  plus a blend of 23 Free Amino Acids and 72 Ionic Trace Minerals to
  nourish the skin. 9. Rice Bran oil, Grape Seed oil and Castor oil are all skin
  moisturizing & enriching and are balanced out with Kaolin Clay to
  keep them from becoming cloying. 10. Shea butter, Coconut oil, Sunflower seed oil, Apricot kernel oil,
  and other ingredients serve as a base, with just enough
  phenoxyethanol, dehydroacetate and benzoic acid to act as broad
  spectrum preservatives. The base lotion is 89% organic and is
  fortified with the 12 additional organic ingredients listed above. COULDN'T JUST ANYONE DO THIS? The ingredients are just the beginning of matters.   Get the
  ingredients in the right quantities, blend them in the right manner
  and order, then administer a few proprietary tweaks.  Most of all,
  create them in small batches and blend in a LOT of LOVE.  Commercial
  producers have no incentive to do this, as the cost of ingredients is
  high.  Love and devotion to excellence makes it worth it! MY QUESTION TO YOU:  ARE YOU WILLING AND ABLE TO ""PAY IT FORWARD""? Now I am asking for your help in funding the initial startup.  This
  involves purchase of equipment, setting up a small production facility
  and obtaining initial supplies and inventory. Friends have already begun giving and you can help us reach our goal
  of eleven thousand dollars ($11,000).  A helping hand at this point
  will enable us to offer our skin care lotion we have named
  ""AGELESS"".   We feel it is unlike anything available on the
  market today! THIS IS ONE SMALL WAY YOU CAN HELP MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE!",https://fundrazr.com/81KgN0

"53,900",Support Legalizing Psychedelic Medicine,Canadian Dollar,,of $50k goal,282,108%,"In the early 1950s, psychedelic drugs were considered promising
  treatments for a broad range of psychological and psychiatric
  conditions. For political reasons, their legal use for healing
  purposes was halted in the 1960s. MDMA was first made in 1912 and was used to improve psychotherapy
      in the 1970's. Both the non-medical and therapeutic use of MDMA
      were made illegal in 1985. Currently, one in six North Americans will suffer from PTSD in their lifetime. PTSD is highly correlated with depression, addiction, and suicide. According to a study published in the CNS Neuroscience &
      Therapeutics Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a
      global health issue, with prevalence rates ranging from 1.3% to 37.4%. 58 veterans committed suicide after their service
      in the Afghan War; many of them had PTSD. A study published in JAMA Psychiatry determined that roughly 271,000 Vietnam vets still have full war-zone-related
      PTSD that meets some diagnostic criteria 40 years after
      the war. While there are various treatments available to those suffering from
  PTSD and related illnesses, the recovery rates and effectiveness of
  current treatments are low. With your help, we can change these alarming statistics and
    help legalize psychedelic medicine. MAPS Canada is in the process of conducting research investigating
  the effectiveness of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of
  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with full approval and
  involvement from Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug
  Administration (FDA). MDMA-assisted psychotherapy combines talk therapy with the use of
  MDMA, (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) a synthetic compound that
  enhances the effectiveness of the psychotherapy by helping patients
  feel more comfortable discussing difficult memories and emotions. In a recently published study, 83% of subjects receiving
  MDMA-assisted psychotherapy no longer qualified for PTSD, and everyone
  who received a placebo and then went on to receive MDMA-assisted
  psychotherapy experienced significant and lasting improvements. The long-term follow-up of subjects receiving MDMA-assisted
  psychotherapy revealed that on average overall benefits were
  maintained for 3½ years or more. Our Swiss study published in 2013
  also found clinically significant improvements in PTSD symptoms after
  MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Independent medical research studies would not be possible without a
  community of supporters like yourself. By making a contribution and sharing this campaign, you will help to
  make MDMA-assisted psychotherapy a legal, approved treatment by 2021. Every gift—no matter the size—makes a difference! How your gift helps Improving the way we heal our society through independent medical
  research studies is costly and would not be possible without a
  community of supporters like yourself. Your contribution will go directly to helping legalize this therapy
  by paying for the cost of administering MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in

110,Help a young family to forge their future. :),Pound Sterling,,of £500 goal,4,22%,"Hi and thanks so much for visiting this fundraiser! In a nutshell: I am looking for £500 funding to help me buy a
        laptop which will enable me to return to my career as a web
        developer and improve my family's quality of life. Why am I doing this? For those who don't know me, I'm Dave, a 43 year old
          family man living in the Isle of Man with my wife, Naomi, and
          two kids, Quill (9) and Fenella (7). In 2014, for various
          reasons, I gave up a successful career as a Front-end Web
          Developer to follow a more practical path and I've been
          working mainly in the building industry since. I'm currently
          working as a ground-worker for a local paving company -
          paving, concreting and building stone
        walls. Over the past couple of years I've really missed web development and
  in 2017 a friend gave me an old desktop computer which I set up as a
  web development machine and I started coding again. In the Autumn I
  upgraded the memory from 4Gb to 8Gb with parts salvaged from a
  recycling centre. The computer works well enough for casual coding but is far from
  ideal as a professional machine. Since 2017 I've worked on a few
  projects and flirted with the idea of setting up a wood working
  business but until 6 months ago I'd not seriously made moves to return
  to my career as a web developer. However, I miss it greatly and I know
  it would be a game changer for us! After several years of providing for my family on a relatively low
  weekly wage (with some assistance from family and the Manx
  government), I really want to break this pattern and get us closer to
  living the life that we wish to live. I've had enough of us scraping
  by in the daily grind. Last year I decided that to make a significant change in our lives, I
  need to return to web development -- it can be pretty lucrative, it's
  what I'm good at, enjoy most and have a great deal of passion for.
  Plus, I'm not getting any younger and I'm definitely feeling the
  effects of manual labour on my body. :) Since July/August last year I've been re-tooling myself by
        following online courses and working on small personal projects
        in my spare time in order to bring my skills up-to-date. I've
        also started to contribute to open source projects (free,
        community developed software with publicly accessible source
        code) and have built my portfolio website, https://crafted.im I've had a handful of interviews since November and have had
        some great feedback from recruiters and interviewers -- one
        local company unfortunately had to pull the job I applied for
        but had asserted that I'd be a great fit for the company and
        they really wanted to give me the job. I'm now awaiting news
        about a remote contract position in the UK  and I'm told they
        gave some great feedback. Fingers crossed! I'm really happy that
        I'm getting interest from companies and so excited to be getting
        back on the right path! https://crafted.im So, here's the
        thing ... If I was to be offered any contract work in the next
        few weeks, I may not be able to take it as my current
        development computer is not mobile (which is essential for a
        contractor/freelancer), it's pretty slow at some tasks and I'm
        unable to use essential tools like Photoshop. So, I am looking
        for funding to buy an entry level laptop with enough power to
        handle professional web development work, which I can later
        trade-in for a fangle-dangle machine once I have established
        myself again. As I can't presently get credit through the traditional
        channels and there's no way with our income that we can save up
        to £500 within a reasonable amount of time, We are hoping that
        Crowd Funding will help us take the next step in our journey. I
        really don't want to just take your money, so I'd like to repay
        the funds. If I am lucky enough to get this funding and I have started
        being paid on my first contract, for any donations received I'll
        return your donation plus 20% or I can donate this to a charity
        of your choice. If you got this far, thank you for taking the time to read
        about our cause. If you can't donate, please share and if you
        can, we sincerely and humbly thank you for helping us out . :)",https://fundrazr.com/abetterlife

960,Let's Get This Barn Dance A Goin!,U.S. Dollar,,of $35k goal,6,3%,"Hi There! We are Pete and Natalie Riley-Morgan and we own Treehouse Flower Farm
  in Naselle, Washington.  We are in our third year of growing and
  selling fresh cut, organically grown, beautiful, put a smile on your
  face, flowers! Our market currently consists of our local community and communities
  that are within a 30 mile radius of our farm.  Some of our services
  include, specialty bouquets, flowers for DIY brides, we have two
  roadside flower stands that are filled with fresh flowers all during
  the growing season, we also offer flower subscriptions for local
  businesses, we sell flowers to local florists and this summer we will
  finally be opening up our U-PICK option here on the farm, so that
  folks may come and pick their own flowers and greenery. In June of this year, we will have completed the build on our first
  treehouse guesthouse and will be opening this charming, luxury hide a
  way for guests to enjoy on the weekends and week days all summer and
  into early fall. Guests who stay with us have full farm access,  a
  home cooked breakfast made with farm fresh eggs and local specialties.
  Treehouse accommodations include hot and cold running water, a
  kitchenette with mini bar, gas fireplace, lounge area, free Wi-Fi, a
  sleeping loft with fresh linens and a 24"" Smart tv. There is a
  wonderful private outdoor shower with hot water and plenty of private
  dressing space and towels are provided. The treehouse is truly a one of a kind experience here on the farm
  and we hope that it is only the beginning of many more to come and who
  knows, with your help, we may even be able to turn our treehouse into
  a bridal sweet during those types of special events! Yes, we want to turn Treehouse Flower Farm into a local wedding venue
  and destination venue, but in order to do that, we need a facility
  that can accommodate at least 100 guests at a time. We have always imagined the big trees down by the river wrapped in
  fairy lights while live music ripples down to the lower property from
  the musicians playing in the barn above. Couples holding hands while
  wandering the grass pathways between the rows of flowers that have
  been adorned in loosely strung Edison lights.  There will be a bar in
  one corner of the barn and a large dance floor where a father can
  share one last dance with his little girl.  Toasts will be made above
  mason jars filled with fresh cut flowers that stand in the glow of
  candlelight on tables dressed with crisp white linens.  A beautifully
  decorated cake stands on a rustic table waiting in the corner to be
  shared by all.  Smiles and the sound of laughter trickle in through
  the open doors of the barn from the wedding party outside, who are
  playfully readying the get away car.  Bellies are content as their
  plates are cleared and the toasting begins.  Later in the evening the
  entire room is dancing and laughing away the night! So many wonderful celebrations yet to take place here on the farm. 
  Like fundraisers for youth programs, family reunions, 50th wedding
  anniversaries, birthdays, community Easter egg hunts. Picnics and
  potlucks, friends gathered around the big open campfire sipping wine
  while enjoying each other's company. Private campsites will dot the
  landscape where tents glow in the night like multi colored lanterns. We are so close to helping build unforgettable memories here on this
  farm, now all we need is that big old barn!  A place where we would be
  able to hold receptions, rehearsal dinners and maybe even the ceremony
  itself, on a rainy spring day.  A place to help our guests stay warm
  and comfortable in the Pacific Northwest's sometimes unpredictable
  weather, a place to celebrate life and all of it's possibilities, but
  we can't do it alone, we need your help to bring all of those
  possibilities into reality. The
  structure will be designed as a 24' x 44' building through post and
  beam construction with cedar siding, and double doors on all sides.
  There will be an upper loft area, a bar, restrooms and storage area
  for tables and chairs to be stowed away when they're not being used. 
  A small prep kitchen for local caterers to utilize or for folks who
  want to cook their own meals and a large storage fridge to hold plenty
  of delicacies for those DIY Brides that want to save a little money by
  catering themselves.  Of course we have a stage design in mind that
  can either hold a live band or a DJ to spin to his hearts content. 
  When the barn isn't busy hosting gatherings, a portion of it will be
  utilized as a processing, storage and shipping area for the flowers as
  they come in from out in the field. We
  purchased the plans for the barn two years ago hoping that by now we
  would have been able to break ground on the build, but with the cost
  of building supplies going higher and higher every year, it will be a
  long time before we will have enough money saved to even begin that
  process and so we are reaching out to you.  Our neighbors, community
  members, friends, family, co-workers and folks who just may want to
  utilize this"" barn/event center"" in the future. Your
  financial support is the most important part in the effort to see this
  project's completion by the end of this summer 2019. It has been a long road to get here and now I'd like to share a
  little of that story with you, so that you might have a better
  understanding of who we are as people and what we're trying to
  accomplish as entrepreneurs . . . A Long Row to Hoe But
    We're Almost There In 2002 my husband and I decided to sell our house in the suburbs and
  purchase some acreage in the country where we could begin to pursue
  our dreams of building our own home, farming and hosting events as a
  way to make a living while enjoying the country life. There we were, two inexperienced young people romping around in the
  middle of nowhere trying to make something special out of our rain
  forest's jungle. While Pete enjoyed clearing the underbrush with the
  help of our little tractor, I diverted water by digging ditches and
  built pathways and bridges using hand tools. Other ""fun"" jobs involved latrine duties by way of a post
  hole digger and a shovel and toting in 5 gallon buckets filled with
  water. It took a few months before we had water and power brought into
  the property from the main road, so until that time, we utilized a gas
  powered generator for power and heat. Eventually I had found a way to
  collect rain water off of a tarp that drained directly into the
  holding tank on the trailer rather  than toting in 5 gallon buckets
  every week.  We wrapped a chain link dog kennel in tarps which became
  our tool storage shed that sat just outside the eighteen-foot single
  wide monstrosity that had become our temporary home. Most nights after a long day of working at clearing brush and trying
  to figure out the logistics of where the house would be built, we
  would sit outside by a fire and enjoy the freedom of the night air. The discovery of the old growth Cedar tree that now holds our
  treehouse was an awesome find, as when we purchased the land, we were
  told that it had been cleared of all of the big trees by a logging
  company ten years earlier.  Pete's great moment was in finally
  breaking through the underbrush and finding the river and with it all
  of the old growth trees that were and still are standing down on the
  lower property. I'll
  never forget, it was a  hot and humid August afternoon when we
  finished loading the last of our belongings into that used eighteen
  travel trailer, hooked up to a friends pickup hitch and headed across
  the Columbia River by way of the Astoria Megler Bridge and into the
  other ""green state"".  We got so sick of living in it that
  trailer that we ended up building an octagonal wooden yurt to live in
  during our final year of building the house.  That small, sturdy
  structure held a king size bed, a desk, a computer, a chair, a TV and
  a phone, but the best thing about it was that it had a solid wood door
  with a deadbolt!  That little yurt still stands today and soon it will
  become part of a new treehouse design here on the farm. We still cooked and showered in that trailer, but once we were able
  to connect the toilet in the main house it sure made the roughing it
  lifestyle much easier. Talk about dedication and devotion, we were both still working our
  regular full time jobs while we were developing the property.  My
  commute was an hour and a half each way.  I worked the night shift at
  a restaurant in Cannon Beach, Oregon. Pete was lucky, he was working as a substitute teacher during that
  time and his commute was only thirty minutes from the property, he
  also coached high school football in Astoria back then, just as he
  still does today in Naselle, but those away games would have him
  arriving back at the property at two in the morning some nights. As I look back and ponder all of the progress and all of the problems
  that we had encountered along the way, it amazes me that we actually
  made it to where we are today.  Just the two of us and our four hands
  with the help of a few good friends and family members, a few tools, a
  tractor and no real building skills to speak of. Now we're proud to say that we live in a home that we built with our
  bare hands and it's fun to get a chuckle or two from folks when we
  tell them the stories about why we built that yurt or how a giant
  fireball jumped into the sky on the day when I blew up the generator
  or how the dogs reacted the first time a black bear meandered by the trailer. The wildlife that inhabits this 80 plus acre peninsula of which our 5
  acres is just a small portion of, has always been endearing.  We have
  seen link, mink, bobcat, cougar, blacktail deer, bear, snow
  owls, great horned owls, eagles, falcons, hawks, tanagers, grossbeaks
  and numerous colored humming birds. Once while we were asleep in the yurt, we were awoke at around two
  o'clock in the morning by the sound of a massive heard of elk as they
  rumbled by.  We had an eight pane window above the head of our bed and
  we got up on our knees and peered out while shining a spotlight beam
  through the panes of glass.  It must have been a migration as we'd
  never seen so many elk in one place at the same time and it took quite
  a few minutes until they disappeared into the darkness and then we
  could hear them crossing the river down below us. We also raised an orphaned fawn for a period of time.  Her mother had
  been killed, so we brought the little fawn back to the house and
  raised her until she was about 4 months old.  It was such a joy to go
  out on the porch and call her name when it was time for her feeding. 
  She would come running, kicking her heels up and mewing like a kitten,
  then she would latch onto that nipple and suckle with so much force
  that it was hard to hang onto the bottle. Over the course of the last 6 years, we have learned to raise
  chickens and ducks for the benefit of fresh eggs and keeping the slug
  populations down in the flower field. We tried turkeys once, but quickly decided that we will never have
  turkeys again, ever! We have seen river otters, raccoons, coyotes with their pups,
  possums, squirrels, bats and mice.  We have raise chocolate labs,
  German shepherds and even a pair of mischievous goats!   And when I
  went back to work as a veterinary technician we did our fare share of
  rescuing special needs cats and kittens. During the course of the seventeen years that we have lived here, we
  have also built and finished the big deck then added more smaller
  decks.  We built the hen house and put up 440 feet run of cedar fence
  along with a chicken run.  We built the sauna and an outdoor bar, a
  woodshed, and the treehouse. Pete’s first experience with a chainsaw was chopping up a 100 foot
  tall Sitka spruce with a 5 foot in diameter base that had fallen
  during a wicked wind storm back in 2005. From that he fell and
  processed more trees that we had turned into firewood (our only source
  of heat) and biochar to use as a soil amendment. We plowed the pasture under and put in the flower rows and with the
  flowers came the necessity of a propagation house, then a little
  greenhouse and then a big greenhouse.  Then more trees came down and
  we planted a lot of grass then built a pretty grand fire pit down by
  the river and a nice water feature plus a couple of ponds for the ducks. So you can tell by the stories that we are hardworking, devoted,
  talented and caring people when it comes to our property, our farm and
  our future.  It's just that at this point, we could really use some
  financial assistance to get through to this next phase of our
    plan. Of course there are still dreams of a fresh water swimming pool,  a
  giant tree swing, a fishing dock perched over one of the best fishing
  holes on the Naselle River with canoe and kayak rentals. Oh and of
  course more treehouses, but all those will hopefully follow along
  behind the barn as the business grows. For now we need to focus on
  financing the barn and getting it built if we want to continue growing
  our business. The above drawing shows the existing layout as to where the barn
      will be located for ease of access from the flower fields. This
      area covers a little under 2 acres, leaving the other 3 & 1/4
      acres of our farm that is not pictured in the drawing.  This
      drawing is not to scale. I guess in farming terms folks, it's been a long row to hoe, but
  we're almost at the end of it.  Of course we could continue as we have
  always done by moving along and building things as we can afford them
  and have the time, but that would mean that it would be at the very
  least, another ten years before the barn would be completed. So we considered the fundraising angle, after all, part of what we
  want to do here on the farm is to host fundraising projects for other
  organizations, so why not try it for ourselves?  Your financial
  support would be greatly appreciated.  Whether you buy a raffle ticket
  in the hope of winning that romantic getaway for two or you simply
  share our story to someone that you think might be interested in our
  campaign and may be able to help, please know that, WE APPRECIATE IT! Thank you so much for taking the time to read our story and if you
  decide to help us out, again THANK YOU! All the best to you. Pete Riley & Natalie Morgan-Riley,   Owners of Treehouse Flower Farm",https://fundrazr.com/31SNAb

    realistically online. The academy had over 700 sign ups and was
    featured on CTV News. We have started development of the TTC 509 Streetcar route for
    Metro Simulator but need your help to cover the costs to finish it. Introduction to Metro Simulator Metro Simulator is a free train simulator for Windows developed
    by independent developers in the Netherlands: http://sim.bemined.nl/ It includes the ability to couple trains, switch tracks and set
    up track routing through the Traffic Control Console: Sjoerd Ydema has developed many of the routes and trains that
    come with Metro Simulator. He has developed the Glasgow subway,
    London Underground and numerous fictional routes. He has also taken
    3D models of the TTC Flexity, PCC, ALRV and CLRV and made them
    available to operate in Metro Simulator: Professionally, Sjoerd works as a traffic management
    engineer/consultant and makes 3D simulations to design the most
    optimal road crossings. This is a simulation he used to test a bus
    station design in the Netherlands: Toronto TTC 509 Exhibition Streetcar Route T2P Films is working with Sjoerd to build the first ever Toronto
    streetcar simulation for the general public. Once released, users
    will be able to drive a virtual Toronto streetcar on the 509
    Exhibition route in Metro Simulator. The track from Exhibition to Union station in both directions
    has already been completed. Some of the buildings as well as the underground portions of
    Queens Quay and Union stations have been added. Objects such as traffic lights, streetcar shelters and signage
    have also been added What is left to do? Major buildings along the route need to be custom modeled, such as: -Exhibition Place complex -Rogers studio at Bathurst and Lakeshore -Recognizable buildings along Queens Quay -Buildings by Spadina loop -Any additional street objects unique to Toronto We have contracted a 3D Modeller who will build the models from
  scratch using 3DS Max. Based on estimates provided by multiple 3D
  Modellers we have relationships with, each building will cost between
  $200-$360 to model and texture. These 3D Modellers are ones we have
  interviewed but they are not directly part of the T2P Films or Virtual
  TTC Academy team. Virtual TTC Academy Streetcar Division Once the route is released, we plan to open 3 streetcar
    divisions in the Virtual TTC Academy: Russell, Roncesvalles and
    Leslie Barns. If you are not currently a member of the Virtual TTC
    Academy, sign up here: https://ttcacademy.t2pfilms.ca/signup.php . We
    will begin hosting runs on the 509 Exhibition route. We may also
    develop the remaining Toronto streetcar routes, adding more routes
    to do runs on. Frequently Asked Questions Q. How much will the route cost once released? A. Free! This one is for the community. We also hope that this will
  help restart run participation in the Virtual TTC Academy. Q. When will the route be released? A. We want the route released as much as you do. However, we are
  unable to provide a date at this time. We will be working with Sjoerd
  as well as Michiel, the lead developer of Metro Simulator to release
  the route as soon as possible. We are hopeful that with your support
  we can get the route released sometime this year. See our perk for
  exclusive updates to receive email updates so you will always know the
  latest on the project. Q. What happens if you do not raise enough funds? Will the
    route still be released? A. We still plan to release the route but it would contain generic
  and placeholder buildings or empty spaces. We would much prefer
  releasing a route that actually looks like the 509 when operating in
  the simulator. The more funds raised, the more key buildings we will
  be able to model. Any amount raised will go directly to the 3D
  modellers for their work. Q. Will you be releasing other Toronto routes such as the 510,
    511 etc? A. No guarantees but if this project is successful we would
  definitely like to develop other Toronto streetcar routes. Q. Will we be using manual control for the Streetcar Division
    of the Virtual TTC Academy? A. Initially yes but if we continue to have strong attendance, we
  will be using the control screen and signalling system previously used
  for the subway runs. Q. Will there really be limited spots in each Streetcar
    Division of the Virtual TTC Academy? A. Yes to prevent virtual operators from all joining one division and
  having limited operators in other divisions. Q. Does the simulator work on Mac or Linux? A. Unfortunately Metro Simulator only works on Windows. However, you
  could explore emulators and virtual machines or just use a friend's
  Windows computer.",https://fundrazr.com/61SlV6

100,Help a 12 Year Old Photographer Begin His Journey Into Macro Photography.,U.S. Dollar,,of $800 goal,6,13%,"Hi, my name is Yaseen Williams, I'm 12 years old and I discovered a
  love for photography. My grandmother purchased a Canon EOS 60D about 5
  years ago, and I recently realized I love photography! After a LOT of research,
    I've realized macro photography is the type of photography I would
    love to do, but it isn't cheap. The lens that I want for this type
    of photography comes in at a whopping (for a 12 yr old) $800. So
    I've turned to Fundrazr to help me raise the money. Please donate,
    and have a nice day! Extra funds will be used for other equipment. Lens facts: Has macro capability
    (close focal distance and 1:1 reproduction ratio), Image Stabilizer
    (small shakes cause big problems without this) USM motor (fast
    autofocus + this lens has a full time manual focus, can focus
    manually while in autofocus) If I get this lens I would use it for: Macro photography (close up) More experience in photography Telephoto (zoomed in photos) Printing/Selling Overall this will help me take better
    photos, become more professional, learning about new lenses and
    their capabilities, and help me follow my dream of becoming a

"6,058",Keep The Bike Pedaler in Downtown Dartmouth!,Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,80,61%,"The Bike Pedaler is moving and we need your
  help to make it happen! Spring is here and so is bike season. It
  was certainly not our plan to be moving right now. When our current
  building at 25 Portland Street sold in January, we were told that we
  had at least a year of status quo, if not a new permanent home. That
  all changed in February.  We found out just a few weeks ago that 25
  Portland Street would soon be demolished and that we needed to be out
  by May. Faced with this sudden deadline we were left hustling to find
  a new space and get it prepped and ready to service the quickly
  approaching bike season. We're happy to share that we have secured a
  space for the new shop just up the street at 61 Portland Street.
  You'll be able to easily find us on the same side of the street, just
  up the hill. A move is big for any business, and with
  such a tight deadline we want to do it right. We know that even a few
  days lost from our regular schedule can throw a wrench (ha ha) into
  our service flow as well as effect the bottom line. We are committed
  to continuing to provide you with high quality service through this
  transition. With a little help from our amazing customers and
  community we are confident that we will be able to save the bike
  season while also giving you a new and improved shop that will stay
  right here in Downtown Dartmouth. From it's home at 25 Portland Street The Bike Pedaler has watched the community change over the
  years. When it first opened, The Bike Pedaler was one of only a few
  new businesses on Portland Street. Now, entrepreneurs continue to move
  into Downtown Dartmouth creating a fantastic atmosphere of vibrancy
  and culture. Marc and his staff have enjoyed being a part of this
  evolution and are proud to be members of a dynamic and growing
  business community. The focus for the shop has always included;
  supporting a repair culture, empowering cyclists, building community,
  and providing quality service in an inclusive atmosphere. When Marc
  first opened The Bike Pedaler eight years ago, the response from the
  community was truly overwhelming from the start (still recovering,
  actually). People flooded in with appreciation and support for a
  bicycle shop in Dartmouth. We have always felt supported by our
  customers and community and we know we can count on that support now. We decided to run a crowdfunding campaign
  because we knew if you knew that we needed help, you would be there.
  We are asking you to help us with what we promise will be an
  investment in Dartmouth, and in the greater cycling community. In
  exchange, we have some great products and services that we know you
  will love! Photo Credits: Cover Photo - Hannah Minzloff Various Bicycle Photos - Kenneth May",https://fundrazr.com/thebikepedaler
570,Help Cory launch ASHTANGA NASHVILLE,U.S. Dollar,"Jul 2, 2019",of $5k goal,8,11%,"Hello everyone, Cory Bryant here. In June I'm moving from my home of
  16 years - Washington, DC - to Nashville, TN to be closer to family
  and to open a yoga shala:  ASHTANGA NASHVILLE. I've been teaching yoga
  in DC for 11+ years and even resigned my position with the FDA in Dec
  2015 to pursue teaching full-time. I love yoga --- study, practice and
  teaching --- and I love sharing it with the world! This is a dream coming true for me and I'm fortunate in that I have
  secured a reasonably priced space in the heart East Nashville to open
  the shala. I'm crazy about the space --- it's simple and lived in
  (I've included a couple photos here). My plan is to get in there and
  clean, paint, add signage and some shelves and bring in the bhav using
  all the awesome dharma prints and statues I've collected. That said,
  these past 3.5 years of full-time commitment to learning and teaching,
  along with the expense of living in DC, have pretty much wiped out my
  resources, so your help is needed. Now, it's not your problem, I know that and I really don't want to
  burden anyone -- but, if you have a bit to spare and you'd be inclined
  to help me out, I will GREATLY appreciate every little bit. It will take some time to reach a sustaining level of cash flow and
  I'm giving up the security that Flow Yoga Center (my yoga home since
  2005) has provided. These first few months I expect I'll have minimal
  income, so the money you donate will go directly to keeping food on
  the table and the doors of the shala open as I work hard to get the
  word out and build the Ashtanga community in Nashville. I'm super optimistic about my chances and will pour my heart into
  this endeavor. The Nashville yoga scene is booming; however, there
  isn't much Ashtanga and there's no Mysore (which will be the bulk of
  my offering), so the opportunity is prime! I'm also excited about
  working with the church -- I've made a commitment to them that
  ASHTANGA NASHVILLE will participate in and contribute to their efforts
  to support the homeless of Nashville through a group called ""Room
  in the Inn"". Thank you so much for all the support over the years and for
  considering financial support as I make this leap. It will be such a
  blessing to see you all enter the shala in the coming years when you
  visit us in Nashville! Om shantih, Cory",https://fundrazr.com/b1UbM8

  Misadventures is a book and passion project 10 years in the

  jobs that would keep me traveling around the world for a decade—I
  couldn’t be more excited that it has manifested and is now published!
  Who knew jotting down random thoughts and experiences in 15 journals
  would turn into a vibrant 300 page book with over 200 photos and 50
  travel stories (from 30+ countries) with eclectic insight into our
  global cultures. Writing, designing and self-publishing a book has been one of
  the biggest challenges and life changing processes I’ve ever gone
  through. It altered my perception of how to analyze life’s daily
  experiences in a way I could formulate and share it for the benefit
  and enjoyment of others—including the stuff no one likes to discuss
  openly in public (getting robbed, being hit on by a monk, and cultural
  experimentation with psychedelics come to mind). My goal is to get
  this book out to as many people and fellow travelers as possible to
  share these moments and misadventures. But what I need now is to get to that final step. I need your
  help to cover the initial production and printing costs so Tales

    shipping from the hotsaucerodz.com Web Store! All donations will be
    eligible for a 15% discount on future orders from the Web Store
    until Jan. 30, 2016! This is my passion in life and I have yet to
    get a negative review on my sauces. Also, on donations over $60, you
    can choose either the Habanero Brown Mustard or the Chipotle Yellow
    Mustard (a $10 bump). The Habanero Brown Mustard is made with
    organic brown mustard seeds (for sprouting), White Balsamic Vinegar
    (Trader Joe's from Modena, Italy) and pecan wood smoked Habaneros.
    The Chipoltle Yellow Mustard also uses organic sprouting mustard
    seeds (yellow), the White Balsamic Vinegar, and Pecan Wood Smoked
    Red Serranos. Quite frankly they are the most amazing mustards out
    there... check out how many ingredients other mustards have and they
    can't match the flavor or shelf life! And please share this with
    your friends! This can help my campaign go viral. There is a Donate
    Tab for my FundRazr campaign on my Hot""Sauce""Rodz FaceBook
    Page. Donate if you can, but please share this with your friends! The Pecan Smoked Habanero Hot Sauce came first, but then I wanted
    a dessert sauce... Enter the Pecan Smoked Balsamic Reduction. At first I intended for
    it to be used where the Italians would use a regular Aged Balsamic
    Reduction sauce, but with a heat and added complexity that the
    peppers could add. it was OK, but needed more... Enter vanilla beans
    and pecan wood aged White Balsamic vinegar to the mix and I have
    seen the light! Vanilla, Chocolate, Mint, and Coffee Ice Cream;
    coffee, fruit, fish, chicken, meats (my friends tell me, I don't eat
    red meat)... I think you get my drift. Both the Habanero and
    Balsamic Reduction sauces are incredible in IPAs, Ales and Stouts
    and put them in a Bloody Mary, Mojito, Mint Julep, Bellini, Mud
    Slide... Again you get my drift, experiment! The other sauces come
    out of filling other niches I've found needed filling. I'm now up to
    16 sauce recipes and 3 of the best mustards I know that I have ever
    tasted, and each only has 3 ingredients. Look at your jar of mustard! Now I'm looking to grow this cottage business to the next level

"1,025",Please help Vanessa fund B-Town Bubbles,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,9,10%,"I need your help to fund my new business, B-Town Bubbles.  Your money
  will help me build a solid and sustainable local product / company
  that will be proactive in our community. Disabled But Want To Work After years of going through the hire / lay-off cycle and
  experiencing first-hand how broken our (un)employment system is; I am
  tired.  My last employer laid me off after I was injured on the job. It has been a real fight with Sedgewick (a private L&I insurance
  company), leaving me to rely on a cane to get around, having my
  treatment slow-walked & blocked, and in pain constantly. Freedom To Make My Own Future I have made a decision; I am not their monkey any more.  It is time
  for me to make something myself, with your help.  Instead of selling
  someone else’s products, I will make and sell my own. Time to take these lemons and make lemonade... lemonade soap that is! My Inspiration Why? This is something I can do and do well.  I began making soap as
  a young child after reading Little House in The Big Woods by Laura
  Ingalls Wilder.  Do you remember that scene where they make those
  brown balls of soap?  I was so excited by this idea!  When we had a
  market in middle school to make and sell our own products, my bath
  salts were quite successful and I have created these as gifts for many years. The West Seattle Tool Library has even hosted my soap making classes: http://wstoollibrary.org/calendar/introduction-to-soap-making/ http://www.sustainablewestseattle.org/2011/12/intro-to-soap-making-the-tool-library/ My classes always sold out and I’d like to think I can do the same
  with my soaps. My Background In addition to having sold these products professionally, and making
  them for years, I have cleaning in my background!  My mother’s
  mother’s mother was Amish and they had a wealth of recipes and ways of
  doing things that we sometimes miss out on in our modern society.  My
  father’s father owned Primer Cleaners in the Chicago area, a family
  run dry cleaning business. Becoming An Entrepreneur I would like to start by selling in small locally owned stores,
  online, at my local farmer’s markets, at local festivals / shows, and
  eventually have a small shop-front here in the Burien / West Seattle
  area.  Then I can offer crafts classes too. My starting product line-up is going to include glycerin style soaps
  that I can make now with the supplies I already have from previous
  soap making.  I can also begin creating cold process soaps that take a
  longer term time investment to make (curing process).  In turn, this
  will create more glycerin to make more molded soaps, making my
  business sustainable.  I also make bath salts, bath milk, fizzy
  products, lip balm, body butter, liquid soaps, bath scrubs, bath &
  massage oils, hair tonic, and even laundry detergent! Where Is The Funding Going? To make my dream reality, I need a bigger place with room for my lab
  / kitchen / workshop as well as storage, and the ability to rent it
  for a few months so I have a real window to work within to see
  profits.  Ideally I would also purchase more supplies, the
  accoutrements of selling at farmer's markets, and packaging for the
  local small businesses that have shown interest in stocking my
  product.  There is licensing, fees for the farmer’s markets and fairs
  (Victorian Country Christmas and others), equipment to set up a mini
  shop at these events (some of it has to be either approved by the fire
  marshal or you buy a specific item that is pre-approved), and other
  supplies and expenses. I really want to build a solid foundation so that my business can be
  a success long term.  That means looking at the building process as
  being a multiple month prospect and having enough capital on hand to
  get through this process. This is where YOU come in!  By being part of the crowd to fund my
  business, you can help make the American Dream come true for me.  This
  is a dream that anyone, anywhere in the world could have; to build a
  successful business, from the ground up. I have several opportunities in local businesses, with farmer’s
  markets, and etc.  There are a lot of options I can pursue but
  building a new business is expensive and I cannot do it alone. Building Our Community I have always been active in my community and want to build my
  business on a model that gives back; donating to my local food banks
  (West Seattle Food Bank), homeless, and other causes (JDRF, NW Hope
  and Healing, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, West Seattle Community

"1,021",Last Minute Gifts Appreciated,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,10,10%,"Better Late Than Never Here we are in the last 48 hours of our fundraising campaign, and I
  want to say, ""Thank you,"" to each person who has partnered
  with us thus far. Monday is fast approaching and what happens in the
  next 48 hours or so in our fundraising will impact what happens on
  Monday. If you have been thinking about supporting us with a gift,
  would you take a moment to make a contribution now? While we might
  have an option to extend our closing, I would much rather be done with
  it and move on with our plans for the future. Thank you SO MUCH for joining us in this endeavor to help invest into
  the Holdrege community. What We Need A little over one month ago the owner of the lot we have rented for
  parking made a business decision that required us to either put
  together a purchase agreement on the property or lose our parking. Of
  course, we couldn't let that happen (as this is an important asset for
  what we do), so an agreement was entered into with a scheduled closing
  date of August 18th, uncertain as to where the funds were going to
  come from. This move was not the first time we had taken a step like this.
  From the very beginning this has been a bit of a faith venture for us,
  but one we knew that we were to embark on. As you are probably aware, we are a small, nearly one year old
  business (September 5th) with a handful of employees, most of whom are
  my family. We have done all we have been able to do to make this
  business a success, but we simply do not have all the cash we need for
  a full down payment on a loan, let alone to purchase the property outright. What I am asking for are some individuals who will help us out.
  Help from individuals who believe in small businesses that help
  strengthen their communities (as I believe we have done) or who
  appreciate family-based businesses such as ours. We are not looking
  for loans, rather, people who would be willing to partner with us to
  invest into our community. Where We Have Been Before we opened, the idea and hope was to create a place where
  people could come together to connect over some food and drinks. This
  was a venue that was seemingly lacking from our community. Our other
  hope was to provide a comfortable environment for all age groups and
  backgrounds to come together and relax, read, study, play games
  or generally engage with other people. I believe we have fulfilled
  both of these hopes, having welcomed nearly every age group from
  middle school students to our 80+ year old crowd and everything in between. During the last year we have regularly hosted everything from
  business meetings, bridal and baby showers, graduation and birthday
  parties, to bridge clubs, Bible studies and a weekly AA meeting
  amongst many other gatherings. All of this would have proven
  challenging without adequate parking facilities. Where We Are Going One thing we are looking forward to with the purchase of this
  property would be the very real possibility of adding a drive-thru
  service window. This would enhance our ability to serve people and to
  provide a great connecting spot well into the future. There certainly
  are other options that have been considered in owning this property
  that would be good for Holdrege, but those are, as of yet, undecided. Will You Help Us Out? There is not much we have to offer for your gift except our
  heartfelt appreciation and the knowledge that you have lent a helping
  hand to someone in need. And so I want to say, ""Thank
  You"" for taking a few moments of your time to even read
  through this request and for sharing this with others in your network
  of friends and family. Brian Steinbach, Owner - 4th Avenue Coffee *Any monies received over the goal amount will be applied towards
  property purchase.",https://fundrazr.com/eq0j4

125,Help One Wet Shoe Media Keep One Shoe Dry,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,3,3%,"By donating to this campaign today, you can help One
    Wet Shoe Media keep one shoe dry while our publisher recovers
  from a slew of serious medical issues. Founded in 2009 by Amee Schmidt , Angela
  Williams , and a loveable chocolate lab, One Wet Shoe
  Media is a small independent literary press, website
  design/programming service, and freelance editing provider. We are interested in publishing new, fresh prose from emerging and
  established writers. Literary fiction that straddles the boundaries of
  realism and the fantastic, the ordinary and the absurd, or that
  stretches the commonplace are especially fascinating to us. We are
  also eager to give voice to minority groups, chiefly women and members
  of the LGBTQIA community. One Wet Shoe provides professional editing, website design,
  and custom programming services to authors, small businesses, and
  various organizations all over the globe. To see a list of our services and to read about the books we have
  already published, see our website at http://www.onewetshoe.com/ . We are expanding quickly now, but a recent tragedy has put One
    Wet Shoe in danger of becoming Two Wet Shoes. Our publisher and
  CEO, Amee Schmidt , has been effectively managing her
  narcolepsy for over twelve years, but in the last few months, she
  began to experience a horde of new and painful symptoms, including
  severe muscle, bone, joint, and stomach pain, fatigue, and depression.
  She knew something else was seriously wrong. After seeing a doctor, Amee has been diagnosed with
  a litany of crippling auto-immune conditions, including Fibromyalgia,
  Osteoarthritis, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, Fatty Liver Disease,
  Pancreatitis, and Cholecystitis. She has also been told that this list
  is likely to grow, as these kinds of diseases tend to appear together.
  Once you have one, you are likely to get more. In the last few weeks, Amee's condition has worsened
  to the point where every day is a struggle. She is scheduled for
  gallbladder surgery in the coming weeks, and this will further
  complicate her abilities to work and sustain the business. Her current
  other treatments thus far have only slightly lessened her daily battle
  with pain. The stress that comes with the inability to work and
  provide for herself and her family only worsens these conditions, and
  it would be a life-saver to have some extra income to ease the
  financial strain. Our goal is to raise $5,000.00 or more by October 31st, 2014. By
  donating to this fundraiser, you will help us keep one shoe dry during
  this difficult time. We hope that this money will help One Wet
  Shoe stay afloat while our CEO seeks further treatment. Help us continue to be the voice for emerging writers and
  organizations. Please donate today and spread the word. We will be
  eternally grateful for any aid you can provide. Sincerely, The Staff of One Wet Shoe Media",https://fundrazr.com/ejpz3

500,Get BORDENTOWN GUITAR RESCUE a new shop sign!,U.S. Dollar,,of $500 goal,10,100%,"Bordentown Guitar Rescue was started in 2012 by one-person (Michael
  Virok) who left a stable job in the music industry to open his own
  shop with a vision of bringing back dedicated personal service to the
  music community. A luthier by trade, Mike has spent nearly all of his
  time and money on keeping the doors of Bordentown Guitar Rescue open
  while providing a high level of experience and craftsmenship to local
  musicians and their instruments. While the shop continues to grow in popularity, it has remained
  almost invisible to most passers-by from the street level, often
  making it difficult for new customers to find the shop among the brick
  facades and other storefronts. The one thing it lacks is a large,
  visible shop-sign. Well, a local sign maker has stepped up and and created a shop sign
  big enough to see from the street level. But, affording the purchase
  price is another story. So, Bordentown Guitar Rescue is asking for
  donations to help purchase the sign in time for the annual Bordentown
  Street Fair on May 17th & 18th. Every little bit helps and all proceeds will directly fund the
  purchase of our new sign. Thank you for your consideration in helping

100,Seeking Celebrity Endorsements,Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,1,1%,"In a world facing unprecedented investment risk following the
  financial meltdown of 2008, market pundits talk of economic ruin
  unparalleled in business history. In this environment, people need
  assistance and may not even know it. We can help. I have nearly completed writing a book combining important investment
  advice with celebrity. It is a unique approach for the investment
  industry. Star power will ensure my message reaches a wider audience.
  I apologize for being vague but if I reveal my “secret” others may
  copy it. I do not want to let the genie out of the bottle until the
  book is published. I am a published author of and contributor to several business books
  and publications. I have also been a financial broadcaster as well as
  a columnist for a major daily newspaper. I have contributed investment
  articles for virtually every significant financial newspaper in
  Canada. I have made investment related presentations across Canada,
  the United States and Europe. I am told by independent parties that I
  have developed an easy communication style that enables people to
  understand and apply useful investment ideas. I am at the stage where I expect to gather, first hand, the celebrity
  commentary to embellish the valuable investment advice already in the
  book. This is where I seek your support. Depending on the
  circumstances, the celebrity stories may be relevant to financial
  advice or simply be amusing stories more entertaining than
  informative. Of course, the idea of star power is to extend the reach
  of my message. I am raising $10,000 to cover the costs needed to conclude the final
  phase of the book. I will pledge to always use the money carefully. When the book is published, in return for a contribution of $75 or
  more, I will send you a first edition copy autographed by a well known
  celebrity. (see 'Perks for your contribution') In today’s world of high economic tension and financial risk, I
  believe this is the ideal time for a book offering serious advice in
  an appealing style. I believe a populist theme will reach and help
  more people. Please contribute NOW to help me help them before it’s

    vintage men's clothing and accessories via my online stores on Etsy
    and eBay. The response has been great but I am running into one issue:
    how to get guys to try stuff on. During the last year (2013) I have been showing my colleciton
    at many of the vintage markets in and around Chicago (Randolph
    Street Market, Vintage Garage Chicago, Chicago FleaMKT, Northshore
    Flea), meeting great people that also love vintage men's clothing
    & accessories.  Unfortunately I can only bring selected pieces
    to these shows, so now it's time to get a space so I can show all of
    my collection, all in one place! My shop concept is to offer gentlemen truly wearable vintage
    that is in line with European fashion trends.  ALL pieces are
    selected by me- spending close attention to details and fabric. I will also be introducing furniture and novelties geared
    toward the refined gent. My work experince is extensive in the retail industry, working
    as a sales specialist and merchandiser for stores such as Neiman
    Marcus, Bloomingdales, Saks Fifth Avenue, Zegna, Escada, Barney's
    New York, Lanvin, and Moncler. NOW... take my love of vintage, my eye for fabric, a keen
    sense of European fashion, flair for merchandising, and willingness
    to help men uprgade their wardrobes and add some style... I think we
    have a winning combination. Where YOU come in... I am currently looking for a live / work space to start this
    endeavour.  Where ever it is, it is going to be FABULOUS!  (Think
    Ralph Lauren, but no where near as expensive)  Having a nest egg to
    take care of incidentals is the key to my success. Stock, fixtures, displays, and almost every other aspect is
    covered and ready...   but finance is the piece of the puzzle that
    puts this dream just out of my reach. Please take a moment to check out my website with links to my
    Facebook page as well as my online stores.  I hope to be a triple
    threat for men in Chicago:  Brick and mortar store, plus online
    stores, PLUS markets.  All that vintage goodness, 3 different ways! My tentative open date will be in June of 2014.  Those that
    have been so kind as to help me achieve my goal will be cordially
    invited to a spring soiree to celebrate! Thank you in advance for your kind assistance.  Let's make it

  cause. We ourselves are having many troubles with restoring our
  building after Hurricane Sandy! We opened up the Concession stand June 10th of 2012 and created
  a large following for Farm to Table Beach goers. We pride ourselves
  with local/organic ingredients that I bought from three farmers
  markets per week last summer for over three months. We have recently been told by the town of Fairfield that our
  building will not be able to serve the public of Fairfield and
  Southport due to the new building codes put in place after Hurricane
  Sandy. The storm wave surge floated our building over Pequot Avenue
  and almost went into the Sasco Creek, if it wasn't saved by the guard
  rail. We have checked out our building and the interior is perfect and
  ready to rock n roll this summer. We invested $30,000 into the beach
  club cafe last summer in our first year of service before we even
  opened. We hoped to make our money back by this summer but with new
  codes set in place by Fairfield coastal engineers, zoning, and the
  building department we look to be at a loss. The director of Parks and
  Recreation said that he tried to find away to help us any way he could
  but after the town assessed the new building codes our structure needs
  $35,000-45,000 worth of work to retro fit the old shack. We are at a
  loss for words and are truly devastated for this predicament. Our
  building looks great, it was renovated on the interior and built like
  a tank last year. The reason it only floated down the road instead of
  being flooded was because of our renovation design. We are looking
  into fundraising. We want to serve the towns beach fare more then ever
  and we need you help!!!",https://fundrazr.com/fUXv9

100,Pay-It-Forward Mobile App,U.S. Dollar,,of $12k goal,7,1%,"Pay-it-Forward Mobile is a Smartphone application that takes
  Paying-It-Forward and charitable giving to a whole new level! This
  free application will allow subscribers to randomly Pay-it-Forward one
  dollar to someone they don’t know. Through an automated or manual
  process, the recipients reciprocate and do the same for someone else.
  The goal is to create a global network of subscribers all
  participating in, and benefiting from the Universal Law of Reciprocity
  - What Goes Around, Comes Around! This is how it works: Download the App and create a Pay-it-Forward account. Deposit $5, $10, $20 or $25 into your account. Link up with your favorite charitable organization. Through a random process, $1 is sent from your account to someone else. That member reciprocates and does the same for another member. Additional funds are generated for the user’s account through
  referrals, mobile ads, and online shopping. Over time, the
  initial small deposit grows into a larger amount which is donated to
  the user’s favorite charity. Subscribers can login and track account
  activities, connect with others, and refer the App to friends and family. The Pay-it-Forward mobile App will be available for both Apple iPhone
  and Google Android Smartphones. Future upgrades include multilingual
  format for international distribution. Our Team: We have assembled a team of volunteer app developers,
  social media professionals, and eMarketing consultants to participate
  in the development and marketing of this fundraising application. Revenue/Sustainability: The basic App is free. The program will be
  self-sustaining through revenue generated from premium upgrades,
  mobile ads, online shopping, and transaction fees. Marketing Strategy/Distribution Channels: Partnerships and
  cross-promotions will be established with non-profit organizations and
  other Pay It Forward Initiatives. Once the App development is
  complete, a branded version will be developed for youth-based
  organizations such as JA, FBLA, and DECA as a fundraiser. A co-branded
  version will be developed for large corporations that can be
  distributed to employees and customers. Launch Date: January 1, 2014 Download Projections: 1 million downloads the first year and 10
  million downloads in three years. Our objective is to make Paying-it-Forward and charitable giving a
  part our everyday experience. This can be accomplished through mobile
  and social technology that is now accessible to almost everyone all
  the time. Considering the social and viral nature of this App, it has
  the potential to grow exponentially with millions of subscribers
  raising millions of dollars for charitable organizations annually.",https://fundrazr.com/1WJJ9

  Engineered, my current music reproduction/ remastery at a
  much greater speed, and Enclosure Engineering at a much
  greater detail, and speed as well! This is the computer in which I plan to get with this
  Fundraiser, a vast improvement over what I currently use. The price

335,The Georgia Mercantile Company MUST MOVE!,,,,,,"The Georgia Mercantile Company is being required to move out of its
  space on Main Street in downtown Senoia, Georgia and needs your
  financial assistance to update a new location suitable for retail
  business. Unfortunately, being located in a prime spot on Main Street
  is risky business when others are interested in it and your lease is
  up for renewal. After almost two years in this location, we will close
  the doors on December 24th. And as the old saying goes - when one door closes, another
  opens...and we will open to a bigger and better future. The new
  location will allow us to grow and do what was the original intention
  of The Georgia Mercantile Company. That intent is to provide a venue
  for products made in Georgia. We specialize in gourmet food items,
  soaps, lotions, candles, art, books, and other great gifts made by
  Georgia artists, authors, crafters, and chefs. In addition, we are like an old, country store with your favorite old
  fashioned sodas, candies, and toys. And, we have been one of the
  must-see shops in Senoia for visitors from around the world seeking
  local merchandise and tourist information for AMC's hit television
  show, The Walking Dead. We have been a local source for custom
  designed shirts, wares, postcards, locations maps, and comics for not
  only The Walking Dead, but other hit films including Fried Green
  Tomatoes, Lawless, and many others. As you can imagine, having to relocate suddenly to a new location is
  a huge financial burden unexpectedly. And as it is Senoia (a.k.a.,
  Woodbury), Georgia where new businesses are abundant, there are no
  spaces available on Main Street and certainly not any that will allow
  The Georgia Mercantile Company to grow. A new location at the edge of
  town is a promising site for The Georgia Mercantile Company. However,
  it needs a lot of work... As stated, we will close our Main Street location on December 24,
  2013. I plan to re-open in the new location early Spring. During the
  break, we will work on the new location to update it and bring it up
  to code. We are asking for your assistance with these expenses. It's
  easier to ask for $10, $25, $100 from a crowd than it is to ask for
  more from a few. Please help us if you can and know that you are
  helping a small business continue to flourish while it offers a place
  for many to share their creations and goods. We THANK YOU for your support and will honor our donors
  whole-heartedly when we make it to our new location by making it our

420,Help me reboot my life with a new DIT career.,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,7,2%,"Hi, I'm Jim Van Cooney, and I am seeking your help for a career
  change. For the last 11 years I've been freelancing as a production
  manager for independent film. The work has made me an administrative
  and technical Renaissance Man, making more with less, making things
  work that didn't, and finding innovative solutions to problems way
  bigger than the budget. But it's an unstable job. I'm looking to switch to Digital Imaging Tech, a relatively new
  position that offers new challenges and opportunities. File based
  workflows have given rise to the world of the Digital Imaging
  Technician or DIT for short. What does a DIT do? Well many things, as
  they seamlessly bridge the gap between production and post. Part of
  their job is safe guarding the digital negatives by duplicating the
  days footage, they also create looks with on-set color correction and
  should have a wealth of camera and post-production knowledge to
  troubleshoot problems with the creation of digital images. Depending
  on the nature of the production that role contracts and expands
  accordingly. Work has become critically scarce in recent years but as
  a DIT I could land gigs on film sets far and near. The proper gear is expensive, however, as is the software. A decent
  portable rig runs about $13K and software is around $6K. As I write
  this I have $0.55 in my Paypal account. So I can see the path but
  can't get past the toll booth. The past three years have been exceptionally hard for me. Limited
  resources have twisted the landscape of the small independent fillm.
  The shrinking pool of projects has left many of the directors I once
  worked for shooting camera or PMing(my job) just to make ends meet.
  This has left me out in the cold. In 2012 my mother passed away and
  just under a year later my youngest sister followed her. As yet I have
  been unsuccessful in returning to a normal 9-to-5 job. The excess of
  competition for what few jobs are out there, and the length of time
  I've been away from the normal workforce have made it terrifically
  difficult, Just getting my foot back in the door has been very tough. If it weren’t for the great generosity of my friends I would be
  starving and homeless by now. If I could get this endeavor off the ground I'm sure I could make a
  go of it. It's such a new position that few professionals specialize
  in it. And low budget independent producers are going to find a
  dependable DIT who already has his own gear to be monetarily attractive. I have worked as DIT on two projects already, and my only problem was
  the suitability of the gear I was working with. With a
  properly-dedicated system I could speed up my workflow and provide the
  projects with dailies to watch each night to better evaluate the
  shoot's progress. Please help me reboot my career and my life. I want to work. I’m not
  getting any government assistance. I don’t want a handout, just a
  hand-up. Life has knocked me down but I’m not out yet. Thanks for even looking at this and considering my plight. I promise
  to ‘pay it forward’ if I manage to get this effort off the ground.",https://fundrazr.com/1hR9d

  designer working at getting my garments available to the public. I'm
  launching my women's wear line early spring next year. In spirit of
  the coming season, I can say bringing my dream to fruition is
  something I am grateful for. Reine + Rebelle is the name of my brand
  which translates to ""Queen + Rebel."" This line is about
  embracing every part of a woman's style. This is why it is called
  Reine + Rebelle, instead of Reine vs Rebelle because in actuality the
  Queen and Rebel are one in the same. A reflection. Style is a
  reflection of yourself, and that reflection may change day by day
  while you remain the same. There are no rules. In life, in fashion, in
  general. Your life, your style, is yours to conquer. The obstacles and
  labels others try to force are irrelevant. Who you are day to day is
  for you to define. You choose, there are no rules. It took so much
  courage to step out on faith and go for what I believe in. To seek a
  life living my passion is something I have always desired. It has kept
  me up plenty of nights, I never knew what steps to take or where to
  start. So I decided to start with love. Seek what you love, the things
  that light you up inside, and the rest will follow. The
  ""How"" will come once you begin to walk in your truth and go
  for your dreams. My women's wear line is my way of getting my message
  to the world. Through fashion, I empower and help others feel good
  about themselves. When you look good you feel good. In your favorite
  outfit, you feel ready for the world and unstoppable. I want to give
  people that feeling, help them remember how beautiful and amazing they
  are. To receive your support would be tremendous, and so appreciated.
  Funding for the samples of my first collection in the beginning was a
  total mystery. One day I woke up with an idea to fund the production
  of my samples for my spring collection. As the temperatures drop this
  seasons I have decided to get sweatshirts printed with my logo and tag
  line ""There are no rules."" If you would like to support my
  journey, I graciously thank you. I am accepting donations of any
  amount on my Paypal account. My goal is to raise 5,000 dollars. Any
  donation of $45 or more will receive a sweatshirt. When you wear it,
  consider it like me giving you a warm hug of thanks and appreciation.

  world and ownership. I am looking to raise $10,000, but hoping to
  reach $50,000 which would completely fund me, from inventory to TP.

  and second is to give back and support the community, specifically
  youth sports. As a youth and teen growing up in a single parent home
  whose mother was working quite a bit, sports were always there for me,
  it was an outlet, a stress reliever. Sports provided another family, a
  group of brothers and father figure coaches. Sports helped shape my
  character and kept me from straying into trouble. I want to be able to
  help ensure other youth have those opportunities. Through the business, I will be sponsoring teams financially and
  helping youth any other way possible through the business. Personally,
  I will continue giving my time to coach and mentor all the youth that
  I have an opporunity to imapct. I want to help build champions of
  character and champions on the field. Every nickel, dime and dollar you give counts and will help make a

100,MSc Research on Howler Monkey Vocalizations,Canadian Dollar,,of $1.5k goal,1,7%,"Hello friends! I am currently working on finishing up my MSc in Primate Conservation
  here at Oxford Brookes University in the UK. For my MSc dissertation,
  I am going to be looking at howler monkey vocalizations and how
  different habitat densitys effect sound transmission through a habitat
  in Balancan, Tabasco, Mexico. For any one who dosen't know much about howler monkeys, they are
  among the loudest land mammals on the planet and thier vocalizations
  can be broadcast at amplitudes of approxamitely 90dB. To put that into
  perspective, when they roar, it can be as loud as highway traffic or
  construction noises. If you are a fan of Spinal Tap, basically, howler
  monkeys go to 13... The vocalizations are associated with an idea known as vocally
  mediated reciprocity, where neighboring groups can judge the proximity
  of the vocalizing individual/group based on how degraded the signal
  is. Unfortunatley, much the the habitat for all living things in
  Central and South America are being degraded by human factors such as
  logging. These changes to the habitat will effect how the
  vocalizations travel and inturn, effect the individuals within the
  forest fragment. THIS is what I will be traveling to Mexico to look at
  and quantify. Great idea right? I know! The only problem is this dosent happen for
  free. My research requires quite a bit of equiptment including GPS,
  vocalization recorders, microphones, windsocks, and tons of other
  field equiptment, along with money to pay the site and field guides.
  Long story short, I NEED YOUR HELP! I will be traveling to Mexico on
  May 15th and I need to purchase all of this equiptment before I go.

  entrepreneurship, and authenticity in our communities. I am honored to have been selected as a contestant for Miss Naturally Crowned Carolina , Columbia, South
  Carolina's very first natural hair beauty pageant ! On
  April 12, 2014, I along with 10 other contestants from Richland and
  Lexington counties, will compete for the title of Miss
    Naturally Crowned Carolina and a chance to win $1000 grand
  prize (non-equity) start up business investment. MISSION: Miss Naturally Crowned Carolina Pageant promotes positive images and dialog about afro-ethnic textured
  hair, while uplifting the beauty and the dreams of women who choose to
  wear it. It would be a truly amazing honor to represent the title of Miss Naturally Crowned Carolina ! I embody what I
  feel to be the foundation of the title which is authenticity,
  positivity, and of course natural hair. I feel that the title also
  represents redefined beauty and self-acceptance. I know that I can
  best represent the title because I personify being bold but yet
  graceful which is the epitome of natural hair. Earning the title
    of Miss Naturally Crowned Carolina would allow me
  to help serve the community by encouraging everyone to see the beauty
  in themselves as well as their ambitions as being obtainable. The
  actual pageant has not yet taken place, but yet I was challenged to
  place action behind my goals. That is what representing the title is
  about! The title alone encourages everyone to believe we are all
  beautiful and capable of achieving our dreams. Society often mocks
  women, “Who do you think you are being bold, beautiful, and brilliant
  with breathtaking natural hair?” If selected to nobly uphold the
  esteemed title of Miss Naturally Crowned Carolina I would graciously
  respond by saying, “Women, who are we not to be bold, beautiful, and
  brilliant with breathtaking natural hair? We are amazing and we are
  destined to do incredible things!” I can best represent the title
  because I would challenge and support women in believing that they are
  diversely beautiful, intelligent, and capable beings. “To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream;
    not only plan, but also believe.” - Anatole France How can you help? I'm glad you asked! Option 1: The Miss Naturally Crowned Carolina pageant
  is self-supporting, all funds raised for the pageant (IN THE FORM OF
  ADS) will go toward pageant operational costs, including titleholder
  prize money, advertising, crowns, sashes, trophies, etc. Any remaining

  honored to have you as one of my sponsors! Any money raised through

460,To start a business to be self sufficient off SSDI,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,12,18%,"Hello Friends! I have the chance to start a floral business that I have owned in the
  past, before I was forced to go on disability and SSI.  The fee's for
  permits and starter supplies, however, are more than I can handle on
  my own, with my current income. There are two farmers markets, and several opportunities within the
  city, that desperately want a Cut Flower vendor in their markets, such
  as the new St. Roch Farmers Market in my neighborhood, and the French
  Quarter Farmers Market, run by the FQ Business association. The concept is to provide old fashioned "" Costermongers"" or
  ""Victorian Flower Sellers"" in costume with baskets of
  Flowers to sell.  < see attached photo""> The name of business is/will be "" NOLA Blooms"". I am asking for my friends to lend a hand and help me become self
  sufficient again by gaining the permits needed in Orleans Parish, and
  the State License I need to sell Cut Flowers.  Funding will also be
  used for the supplies I need to get started, such as buckets,
  preserver, wire, ribbon, flowers, baskets and more.  However, the bulk
  is for the many fee's required by Orleans Parish to do business in the
  French Quarter legally. I know this will work, and I know I can make this a success for me. I
  have already been doing some marketing, and have talked with those in
  both Markets, and they are extremely excited to have someone wiling to
  be in said Markets. I have also been out and about in the public to see how well the
  concept would work here in New Orleans, and I was actually amazed at
  the welcome I received both from the public and from businesses in the area. I believe, with the right backing, and support, along with the proper
  permits, I can make a life for myself again and thus become self
  sufficient again.  Living on 730.00 a month allows me nothing, but low
  self esteem, depression, and constant worry and stress. With my
  disability of COPD, PTSD, and Clinical Depression, holding a normal
  job is not feasible, as many days I just cannot breath and thus can
  not leave the house.  Owning my own business allows me to work when I
  can and only several days a week. I so want to live as normal a life as I can, even with my limitations
  and to be a productive member to society. If you have any questions, please let me know!!  I will be happy to
  answer any you may have.",https://fundrazr.com/0fTF1
"1,530",ManCakes! Join the Cupcake Revolution.,Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,9,15%,"How it all began... Things start off in 2008 when the three of us at all crossed paths on
  an elite level cheerleading team that came 4th at the World
  Championships (We know it's random!). As cheerleaders (we know this
  sounds super manly), we were constantly surrounded by many girls (perk). As we were all hanging out, one female cheerleader on our team had
  purchased cupcakes for all of us to share. The cupcakes were okay, but
  all the guys around the table admitted that we rarely ate cupcakes
  unless they were purchased by a girlfriend or female friend of ours.
  As we chatted, the girls continued to claim how great cupcakes were.
  Pink, frilly, frosting, sprinkles - characteristics that had zero
  appeal for us guys! This is where ManCakes was born. Geoff and I entered into a discussion with the girls about all the
  ways that cupcakes could be improved.  More interesting flavour, not
  overpoweringly sweet ... fillings!  We realized that there was huge
  potential to improve on this dessert that hasn't changed in years.
  Only problem? Neither of us had any baking experience! Enter Tyler. As
  a trained pastry chef and good friend, we immediately began mixing
  flavours and combinations in the kitchen. As Tyler experimented, Geoff
  and I worked to build the branding and business development necessary
  for any idea to get off the ground. One year later, in December of
  2011, ManCakes Bakery was officially launched online. Over the next year and a half ManCakes grew exponentially. We were
  blown away that people felt so passionately about our cupcakes.  We
  were, and continue to be, so grateful to all the people that have
  supported us throughout our journey.  As well, we are very excited to
  add new supporters through fundrazr! Whats next for ManCakes... We currently use a small kitchen in Port Coquitlam that only has the
  capacity to produce a smaller number of cupcake flavours. But we want
  to GROW, and to do that we need a kitchen of our very own inside our
  shop. This will allow us to expand our line of ManCake flavours, and
  introduce a new line of products that will compliment our cupcakes!
  For now, we'll call these our ""mystery delights."" In
  addition, we would like to add a full suite of high quality espresso
  products.  To do that, we need to invest in an espresso machine that
  can produce these drinks in a way that meets our high expectations. We loves ""firsts,"" so with your help, we could become one
  of the first Vancouver food establishments to utilize crowdfunding to
  help our expansion! Summary of Fund Usage : In-store development kitchen - $5000 Espresso machined for specialty drink program - $3000 Development costs for new line of ""Mystery Delights"" - $1000 Development costs for new line of specialty ManCakes drinks - $1000 Why it is so important for us... We designed our cupcakes to be eaten! Not too sweet or piled high
  with icing and sprinkles. Combine this with unique and interesting
  ingredients and flavour combinations and you get flavours like Bacon
  Chilli Chocoloate, Rum & Coke, King Kong and Breakfast, to name a
  few. Shortly after we started hand delivering our online orders of
  ManCakes, we realized that the cupcakes were a hit! It was always in
  our dreams to open up our own café so that we could share our new
  cupcakes with the world. Thankfully, the media caught wind of our new found passion and as our
  exposure increased, so did the demand. We started getting increased
  requests for pick up orders. Unfortunately we did not have a retail
  location to facilitate pick ups. Customers were limited to online
  orders that were delivered three days a week. After being featured on
  CNN, the Vancouver Sun, Virgin Radio and a host of other media, we set
  out to grow ManCakes Bakery into a true café and reach the goals that
  we have set. This is our dream. We are making this happen! We want to
  turn ManCakes Bakery into a cupcake phenomenon that can be enjoyed
  nationwide and abroad! How ManCakes Bakery Café is doing... People LOVE ManCakes! We have just opened our first ManCakes Bakery
  Café , so that you can come enjoy cupcakes whenever you want. Our
  customers are wonderful and have a lot to say: ""I don't really need an excuse for having dessert for breakfast,
  but if you do, then here it is!"" - Mijune Pak (Follow Me Foodie,
  Vancouver food blogger) “The flavours go so well together and I haven’t tasted anything this
  good in New York or Los Angeles.”- Alex Wong (So You Think You Can Dance) ""Oh My Gosh...these ACTUALLY taste amazing!"" - Jen (Store customer) ""I never could’ve guessed how delicious Frank’s Red Hot could be
  in a baked good. You’ve got to try it to believe it."" Erin
  Ireland (To Die For Vancouver, Food Blogger) ""Amazing, delicious and tremendously creative"" - CNN ""This is the coolest idea I've see in years!"" - Steve
  (Store customer) ""Mancakes has, within its pastry case, the greatest cupcake to
  ever grace the culinary streets of Greater Vancouver"" - YAHGlowbal.com The most Interesting cupcakes you’ll ever taste. Period. We make cupcakes in flavours that EVERYONE wants - a worlds' first!
  You’ve really got to try them to fully appreciate the awesome taste
  sensations of Buffalo Wing, Breakfast, Rum & Coke, Chocolate Red
  Wine, Bacon Chili Chocolate, and more! Don’t believe us? Have a look! Rum & Coke You
  may not remember where you went last night… or the girl you have
  listed as “that girl from the bar” in your phone… but you will
  absolutely remember these Rum and Coke cupcakes. The strong taste of
  coke mixed with a punch of rum is the perfect start to a great night
  that you might remember. Description: Vanilla base filled with strong cola cream, rum infused butteream
  icing, crushed coke candy topping. Bacon Chili Chocolate When John M. Carleton invented ancho chili chocolate in 1934 he
  dreamed of combining it with bacon to make bacon chili chocolate
  cupcakes. Never able to perfect it, his son Timothy took up the charge
  in 1968. Sadly, Timothy died later that same year in a bizarre cupcake
  accident. The quest was abandoned… until now. (None of the that is
  true except that we have a Bacon Chili Chocolate cupcake, and it’s awesome) Description: Chocolate base filled with ancho chili infused chocolate ganache,
  vanilla buttercream icing,  crumbled bacon topping. Apple Brie You work hard. And does anyone appreciate you for it? Probably not.
  So why not kick back after a long day, pour yourself a glass of wine
  and enjoy this delectable combination of Apple and Brie. And if that
  “to do” list starts to creep back in your mind, just remind yourself
  that someone needs to finish all these cupcakes. I mean, if someone
  has to do it, it may as well be you. Right? Right. Description: Spice base filled with a sweet apple cider jelly, brie buttercream
  icing, crushed pretzel brittle topping. Chocolate Red Wine In a recent article of Scientific America there was a study of which
  foods are the most powerful aphrodisiacs. For men, it was found that
  no food was necessary… just women. And for women it was found that
  chocolate and red wine were off the charts. So, to all my friends out
  there looking for a good night… You are welcome. Description: Chocolate base filled with mascarpone mousse, port cherry red wine
  infused buttercream icing, dark chocolate disc and red wine gelee topping. Buffalo Wing Buffalo Wing cupcake… that’s weird right? Wrong. You want to know
  what’s really weird? Who’s ever heard of a buffalo with wings? I mean,
  that doesn’t make any sense. Can you imagine getting pooped on by a
  flying buffalo? Good luck or not, that would ruin your day. Next time
  you think something’s weird, maybe you should take a second to think
  about what you’re saying. Description: Spice base filled with tangy baked blue cheese cheesecake mousse, hot
  sauce infused buttercream icing, crispy chicken crumble topping. King Kong Tarzan has Jane. Mowgli has Baloo. And King Kong has these cupcakes.
  One taste and you’ll feel like you’re in the movie! Climbing the
  Empire State building, fighting a T-Rex, and being captured by Jack
  Black… Geez… that movie was terrible. On the bright side, these
  cupcakes are fantastic. Description: Chocolate base filled with a banana cream, espresso infused
  marshmallow icing, chocolate shavings. Tequila Pineapple Picture yourself on a tropical beach. You’re sitting on a comfy
  chair, reading a book, ogling the pretty women and sipping a tropical
  drink. Now snap out of it. You’re not on a beach. You’re in front of
  your computer ogling cupcakes. But fear not. One taste of this Tequila
  Pineapple cupcake and you’ll be brought right back to your relaxing
  fantasy land. Description: Spice based filled with pineapple cream, tequila infused buttercream
  icing, toasted coconut shavings. Breakfast Now, we don’t want to say this is a hangover cure (because it isn’t),
  but everyone feels better eating a hearty breakfast after a hard
  night. But who’s going to spend the time to cook the eggs and bacon
  and put it on pancakes with maple syrup… uh! What a pain. Instead,
  pick up a pack of Breakfast cupcakes and you’ll have the whole
  experience ready for you when you wake up. Description: Vanilla base with a smoked bacon and egg custard filling, maple syrup
  infused buttercream icing, crunchy crumbled granola topping. Whiskey Lime It's
  a special type of person that will truly appreciate a whiskey lime
  cupcake. What type of person you ask? He's avoids cologne because
  women prefer his natural musk. As a child, he singly handedly evicted
  the boogieman from his closet. The sun puts on ""him-screen""
  for fear of getting burnt. You get the idea... Description: Spice base filled with whiskey infused chocolate ganache, white
  chocolate lime icing, lime sugar topping Pink Peppercorn Grapefruit - ""The one for the girlfriend"" Remember
  that time that you did that thing, or said that comment and she got
  mad at you for it? And do you remember that really expensive gift that
  you got her to make up for that thing that you did or said? Well,
  those days are behind you. Next time you mess up, and there will be a
  next time, just be sure to have a Pink Peppercorn Grapefruit cupcake
  on hand and she’ll forget all about it. It’s the perfect crime. Description: Vanilla base filled with a blood orange & pink grapefruit
  custard, vanilla buttercream icing, shortbreak cookie & ground
  pink peppercorn topping.

260,Help VCMA Create Healthy Venture Capital Markets,,,,,,"The Venture Capital Markets Association (""VCMA"") is a non-profit association formed to represent
  public companies seeking a Canadian regulatory environment offering
  access to speculative investment opportunities and capital through
  fair securities markets that warrant public trust. It seeks to
  influence improvement in regulations to ensure that they are clear and
  easily understood and that they allow for effective policing and enforcement. For over 100 years Canada has been a world leader in providing
  venture capital for speculative investing in mineral exploration,
  mining, technology, life sciences, and energy. Zealous over-regulation
  by a multitude of governing organizations is rapidly bringing venture
  funding to a halt. Everyone involved in the many aspects of Venture Funding that is
  being affected by Canadian regulatory bodies is invited to join
  the Venture Capital Markets Association. All funds will be used to petition and lobby politicians across
  Canada to influence the introduction of regulations that allow the
  formation of capital leading to discovery, innovation, and jobs.  To
  date, the VCMA has relied on volunteers and pro-bono services.  The
  more support we gain, the more of a difference we can make! For corporate sponsorship or volunteer opportunities to support this

200,Help us make Off Track,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,4,8%,"Essentially, we are two young aspiring film makers from a small beach
  town on the east coast of Florida. Living in paradise does a number of
  things to a persons mind. A place like the one we are from inspires
  lots of creativity and passion in its people. At the same time, the
  peaceful nature of our town can lull a person into a deep complacency. Our story shows both sides of this. It focuses on the town itself and
  the young people trying to bring excitement of various types into
  their lives. Our goal was to create a story-line that was both
  visually and sonically compelling.The screenplay itself is recently
  completed, and ready to be filmed. The young talent of the area is
  behind us on this, giving us the moral support to bring this to
  fruition. Our peers seem to be just as excited about being a part of
  this as we are to present it.The money we are asking for is to keep
  our cast and crew happy first and foremost. Another portion is
  intended for props, make-up, and other minor equipment. All for the
  goal of making this movie a pleasant experience. Not only to view, but
  to create. We thank you for your time and support, and hope you will join us on
  this adventure to water the seeds of our passion. The film itself revolves around the lives of 16 young people who are
  all effected by the circumstances of the world around them but also
  the choices they make. It’s a gritty but also sometimes funny and
  exciting look into the young souls trapped in a downward spiral of
  small town crime. When a petty robbery goes wrong two junkies find
  themselves pursued by both the law and other criminals. A fresh faced
  young man’s experiments with illicit drugs turns into a nightmare for
  party goers. An everyday clerk moonlighting as a street artist has
  high hopes for using art to change the way people look at the world.
  All these people’s stories intertwine as the events of a single day
  play out while Murphy’s law is in full effect in the film Off Track. With any film there are bound to be challenges. But any challenge on
  a film can be over come with ingenuity and know-how. I've been making
  short films and working on freelance video projects for years and have
  yet to come across a goal I set for myself that I was unable to
  achieve. Some of the scenes in the film will require a little movie
  magic but I believe nothing is impossible when making a film. The
  story was crafted by working with what we have access too. One of the
  many things we have access too is a large community of young people
  like ourselves, many of whom are members of the International Thespian
  Society. Any unseen challenges that arise will be met with tenacity,
  patience, and creativity.",https://fundrazr.com/5haxa

  Recognition in Science and Technology) LEGO League Robotics Team! Robotics is like a science club devoted to discovering and inventing
  new and innovative solutions to help solve problems around the
  world. Each year teams research, create and develop ideas based on a
  theme. This year our theme is Nature's Fury. Our team's job has
  been to program an autonomous robot to score points on a thematic
  surface and create an innovative solution to one of the natural
  disaster problems we identified in our research project. Like other organized clubs or sports it is necessary to raise money
  to allow us to complete our goals. Money that we raise is used for
  things like purchasing supplies for our quadrocopter (part of our
  solution this year), travel expenses for competitions, and field trip
  opportunities...just to name a few. To earn money this year we are selling ""F.I.R.S.T. Green e-watt
  saver"" LED light bulbs. These are eco friendly and cost efficient
  alternatives to regular light bulbs. The estimated yearly energy cost
  is $1.63 (based on 3hrs a day of use). The estimated life of the light
  bulb is 22.8 years (based on 3hrs a day of use). To be clear, we have not tested the validity of the information
  provided in regards to the life of the bulb. We are however using one
  in our home and we can let you know in 22.8 years if it lasted this long! You can help support us financially by buying a light bulb (suggested

  travel to many towns which are filled with fantastical culture, worlds
  away from life in England. I’m especially interested in the Medical course as it has a rotation
  across a number of different departments. With the help of supervisors
  I will be able to oversee and learn various procedures involving work
  in a leprosy clinic and also experiencing 5,000 year old traditional
  Ayurvedic medical treatments. I will be fortunate enough to shadow
  local medical staff and assist with diagnosis and treatments of
  conditions that never develop beyond the primary stages in the west. I believe this trip will enhance my future prospects and aspirations
  of doing medicine at university as I will learn to become more
  independent and self-confident. It will also help me broaden my world
  view and create a lifelong impression of other societies through
  connections with people I meet in India. From now until summer, I will be organising several fundraising
  events, including a sponsored run and sponsored bake sale to raise

  sketching clothing designs ever since she was 5 yrs old. When Destinee
  turned 8 the designs that she put to paper were so amazing that me and

280,Support Animal Research in the Amazon,U.S. Dollar,,of $4.5k goal,6,6%,"Hello! My name is Amy Cote. I am a Canadian University student
  pursuing a career in conservation biology. In order to expand my
  knowledge in this field, I am going on a research expedition to the
  Peruvian Amazon next summer to study the indiginous wildlife and help
  promote sustainable hunting and fishing practices. This expedition is
  run by a research group called Operation Wallacea. Operation Wallacea is a biodiversity and conservation management
  organization running projects in Indonesia, Honduras, Cuba, South
  Africa, Madagascar, Peru, Guyana, Mexico and Romania. The research is
  carried out in conjunction with academics from many European and North
  American Universities, and also relies on students like me. The aim of
  Operation Wallacea is to study wildlife around the world and use this
  knowledge to help protect biodiversity, encourage conservation, and
  develop sustainable practices that can benefit future generations of
  animals and people. For more information about Operation Wallacea you can go here . So, why Peru? The Amazon Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse places on the
  planet. It has been estimated that approximately 10% on all the
  animals in the world live in the Amazon.  In addition, the Amazon
  Rainforest is home to many undiscovered species. In the last four
  years alone, over 440 new species have been discovered in the Amazon.
  Unfortunately these animals are in danger due to human activities such
  as farming, over-hunting, poaching, and deforestation. Operation Wallacea aims to help alleviate some of these risks by
  studying their impact on animals. The research is used to find a
  balance between the needs of the indigenous people and the
  conservation of the animals and plants. Students with Operation
  Wallacea spend two weeks aboard a research vessel travelling down the
  Amazon River. During this time they complete courses in Amazonian
  ecology and learn the techniques required to study and handle animals.
  Once these courses are completed students can participate in various
  research projects. For more information on the research being done in the Amazon you can
  go here . That's where I come in. I would like to go on one of these research expeditions to aid in the
  biodiversity research. But, I need your help. These expeditions are
  costly and even working a job to pay off some of the costs is not
  enough. Your money would be helping me pay for: Expedition Costs = $1850 - includes
    accomodation, food, support research staff and medical insurance Airfare= $1500 - includes roundtrip airfare from
    Toronto, Canada to Lima Peru, and and a round trip internal flight
    to Iquitos Peru where the expedition starts Vaccinations= $500 - due to the nature of this
    trip vaccines are important to prevent disease spread by animals or mosquitos Equipment= $500 - waterproof hiking boots,
    sleeping bag, rucksack, head torch, binoculars, ect. Travel Insurance= $100 As you can see, there are considerable costs to an expedition like
  this. Your donation would be very helpful. I simply couldn't thank you
  enough if you decided to aid me in my journey. I'm sure if the animals
  of the Amazon could, they would want to thank you too.",https://fundrazr.com/5dQa4

  stopped working, and I need to purchase a new one. They are not cheap
  so I thought maybe those that have benefited from all the photos I
  have taken over the years might help me out. :) Any little bit will help. (NOTE: I have received some donations outside of this site so the
  target here reflects what is not raised). Since 2008, I have been volunteering my time as a photographer in
  South Portland (Maine) and various neighboring communities taking team
  and game photographs for high school and some college sporting events.
  Many of you have asked how you can pay me for the photos and I usually
  say no worries. Maybe you can help me now! I thought I would reach out to you all, for a change. I have rarely
  charged for my photos because do it out of the love of the games,
  friends, and community. I post the photos on Facebook for parents and
  athletes, and donate my photos to the high schools and booster clubs
  for free use in their athletic programs and yearbooks. I have taken
  over 10,000 photos and willingly give the high resolution images to
  the booster clubs, parents, or athletes for their final banquets or
  senior awards. Presently I'm shooting games with the same lens set to
  manual focus, and it's not easy or practical. It will cost $300 to get
  the lens evaluated for repair, and then repair will be in addition to
  that fee. This is the second time this has happened so therefore would
  like to purchase a new, reliable lens to continue taking photos for
  the schools and athletes. The lens that is recommended for my camera,
  and comparible to the one I had is the new Sigma 70-200mm F2.8
  telephoto lens ( APO 70-200mm F2.8 EX DG OS HSM ).
  I have looked at used lenses but I prefer not to buy someone else's
  problems. A new lens is $1400. I shy away from asking for payment or donations. I thought perhaps
  this way would be a low-pressure way to solicite donations towards a
  new lens so I can continue to take photos for the booster clubs and
  the athletes for the spring sports. If you have enjoyed the photos I
  have taken of your team, your children, or yourself and want to help
  repay me for this, here is your chance. THANK YOU! (if you don't wish
  to donate through this site, just contact me directly. Any little bit

  proven clinical trial tools. Our Story Our daughter, Téa Marie, was born in October of 2012 following a very
  uneventful pregnancy. Naively, I imagined that her delivery would go
  according to the birth plan I had meticulously written and distributed
  to the day’s key participants. But nothing went according to plan that day. After 17 hours of labor, Téa came into the world by way of emergency
  C-section. She had very low muscle tone and did not eat or cry. Later
  we would learn that she probably wasn’t strong enough for a natural birth. We spent 10 emotional days in the NICU where they ran every test
  possible, including an MRI, X-ray, EEG, EKG and genetic tests. We
  waited anxiously as each of the tests came back negative. On the day
  we were discharged we received the heart breaking news that Téa has a
  rare genetic disorder called Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). As soon as we learned they were running the genetic test for PWS we
  ran to the Internet. What we found was terrifying. Beginning in
  childhood, individuals with PWS develop an insatiable appetite, which
  leads to chronic overeating and obesity. We read stories about individuals with PWS stealing food, eating food
  out of the trash and literally eating themselves to death. Families
  are forced to lock their refrigerators in order to keep their loved
  ones safe. We took Téa home and spent a couple of days grieving. Then we took a
  deep breath and set out to rewrite her future. We did not know it at the time, but what we did next was the basis
  for TREND. First, we found Dr. Jennifer Miller at the University of Florida. Dr.
  Miller is a leader in PWS research and care. She started Téa on growth
  hormone therapy and connected us with Melanie Silverman, an
  experienced nutritionist. Dr. Miller explained that children who are on growth hormone therapy
  and follow carefully controlled, healthy diets are doing very well.
  They maintain healthy weights and have delayed onset of hunger. When
  they do enter the hunger phase, called hyperphagia, the hunger is less
  severe. Things were certainly looking brighter. Next, I connected with an amazing group of “power moms” on Facebook.
  They were exploring therapies and diets, sharing their experiences
  and, together, solving small pieces of the PWS puzzle. They observed
  that certain foods, macronutrient ratios and supplements seem to
  increase mental clarity, improve energy and promote fullness. The data
  geek in me wanted to formally collect this information and take a
  closer look. How wonderful would it be if we could improve the quality
  of Téa’s life so dramatically through diet! My husband and I own a web development company and we built a
  web-based clinical trial application in collaboration with the Wistar
  Institute. What if we could make these powerful tools available for patients and caregivers to track and
    share their data? With the help of other members of the PWS
  community, we created TREND. TREND, is designed to crowd-source data. It will enable us to
  evaluate the effectiveness of new and established therapies and share
  our findings with our doctors. Our intention is to partner with our
  doctors to make more informed decisions for Téa. We also hope to
  identify promising experimental treatments that can be moved swiftly
  to clinical trial. Here’s what we have so far We built a secure, web-based platform to collect and store electronic
  data using highly configurable forms. These tools have been used in
  clinical trials and vetted by trained professionals. For more
  information visit us @ http://wi-design.com/trend/ . We seek funding to conduct our first TREND experiments. We will
  recruit communities of parents to track their children’s diets and
  supplements and answer questions pertaining to quality of life. We
  will share this data with the medical and scientific communities to
  determine if further dietary restrictions should be considered in PWS. Why we need FundRazr We will use our FundRazr seed money to transform our existing
  platform into a community empowerment engine and run our first TREND experiments. Our new, user-friendly tools will include: the TREND Experiment
  Wizard, TREND Community Builder, and What’s TRENDing announcement board. The TREND Experiment Wizard will help users propose a hypothesis and
  design their data collection forms. The TREND Community Builder will connect users with TREND experiments. And, the What’s TRENDing Announcement Board will provide real-time

  light, and frequency to create an environment for your body to heal itself. According to Joe Columbo, Ph.D., of the ANSAR* Company, independent
  research conducted by their company reveals that spending time in the
  chamber “ can help one’s autonomic nervous system (ANS) to
    normalize, a nd follow-up reports from patients suggest that the effects of
    this therapy can be long term. ANS monitoring shows that there is an
    autonomic effect . . . that seems to help contribute to the
    patient’s overall improvement in health.” [*ANSAR (Autonomic Nervous System And Respiration) is a
  diagnostic device that evaluates the balance between the nervous
  system (stress) and heart function.] Practically everyone, regardless of age or state of health, can
  benefit from the EGS chamber. From the time we take our first breath
  we’re all exposed to varying degrees of stress throughout our lives,
  whether it be due to physical trauma (i.e., accidents, broken bones,
  sports injuries, etc.), emotional trauma (i.e., loss of a loved one,
  heartbreak, rejection, etc.), or environmental trauma (i.e., exposure
  to heavy metals, toxins, pollution, etc.). Each one of us is carrying
  the imprint of our traumatic experiences in our bodies, whether we’re
  aware of it or not. The effects of chronic stress may manifest
  differently in each of us, but the effects are always detrimental to
  your health. |Please note: The EGS Chamber does not diagnose, cure or heal any

  decided to expand my part-time shamanic healing practice, Lucid Path Healing Arts , and open a new center
  in Montpelier, Vermont that will feature this groundbreaking new
  technology. The center will be called Lucid Path Wellness . Because the cost to purchase an EGS chamber will require financial
  resources that our beyond my means, I’ve decided to take the advice of
  a knowledgeable business person I recently met and reach out to
  members of my community, and beyond, to see if together we can raise
  the funds needed for the $35,000 down payment, as well as the fee to
  use this website. The business plan we’ve developed will effectively
  cover the price of the remaining balance of the EGS chamber and
  additional start-up costs. LUCID PATH WELLNESS WILL OPEN REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT

"1,050",Help Carrie fund her dream of owning business!,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.5k goal,12,70%,"Hello Dear Friends and Family; For as long as I can remember, I've dreamed of owning a small
  business.  In the last year since I moved to Victoria, British
  Columbia, I've seen many small businesses thrive and succeed with a
  unique and desirable product.  Thus, I've realized that my dream can
  be an obtainable reality.  I've worked in several industries: most
  recently as an apprencice on organic farms; as a kitchen assistant in
  a health-food cafe; in public outreach for a local non-profit and
  currently in a sales position with a local food business at a very
  busy public market.  It's taken me a while to come up with the ideal
  business plan that supports my passion to support local agriculture
  here in BC, while offering a desirable, nutritious, affordable food
  product.  My business will involve a vegetarian local food product
  that would be served out of a mobile hot-dog cart.  My target customer
  base would frequent local markets, festivals and concerts in the
  Victoria metro area. So far in Victoria, there isn't a mobile food business that cateres
  entirely to vegetarians (not that I'm aware of anyway), and I believe
  this product will be a fun and healthy alternative to the greasy
  burger or hot-dog (even though I know these food items serve their
  purpose and I'm not above them).  The reason I'm reaching out to my
  loved one's through this fundraising approach is becuase I've found a
  great small business loan that would support the business for at least
  6 months and allow it to get up and running.  The total loan is
  $15,000 and I would need at least 10% of that amount saved in order to
  qualify ($1,500).  I originally intended to save this money myself -
  but with a part-time income and going to school it would delay the
  project another year before I could get the money saved.  In addition,
  the business would need to launch by late spring/ early summer of 2014
  in order to have a successful start.  This way the business is
  available for the busy tourism season, and the festivals and markets
  here in BC.  Furthermore, once I have the funds I can promply apply
  for the loan and get the mobile-cart, commercial kitchen space,
  marketing materials etc. Most importantly, I know this may not be the most preferred approach
  to obtaining funding, but I've waited and waited for the right time,
  and I'm excited and ready to finally take action!  I have a strong
  desire to contribute my grain of sand to the world with a bit of
  creativity and nourishment while supporting our local BC food
  producers.  Now is the perfect time here on Vancouver Island as the
  mobile food industry is just starting to really take off. Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this.  I am
  forever grateful to anyone that is willing to contribute.",https://fundrazr.com/2hbxd

  like family members would. Earlier in 2014 the school was forced to relocate on short

    can be a vehicle for positive change that extends beyond making
    pretty dresses. FASHIONABLE GIVING My company focuses on preserving traditional Balinese handcraft
  techniques, while promoting creativity at a local orphanage. The
  long-term goal is centred on the redistribution of company funds
  toward various social projects in the Balinese community. Teaching English at a local orphanage. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- URGENT! We have only 10 days left to raise $17K towards my

210,Critically Endangered brown spider monkey research,Pound Sterling,,of £1.5k goal,10,14%,"Hello all. As you all probably know, I’m really into monkeys. After spending 3
  years working for a Bolivian NGO which aimed to help wildlife
  displaced by the pet trade, I started a Masters course in Primate
  Conservation at Oxford Brookes University to study some of the world’s
  most endangered primates, in an effort to ensure they’re still around
  for my nephew Finlay to marvel at when he’s my age. I’m asking you, dear friends, for a few quid to help me achieve my
  goal. I know Facebook and the like is plagued by such calls for aid,
  and you’re probably tired of hands being held out for your hard earned
  cash, but a couple of pounds here and there could make a lot of difference. My project aims to study the Critically Endangered brown spider
  monkey ( Ateles hybridus ) in Colombia, where only and
  estimated 9% of its potential habitat remains as continuous forest.
  The rest of the brown spider monkey’s current habitat is made up of
  isolated forest fragments, areas where patches of forest have been
  disconnected from the surrounding forest, primarily by forest being
  cleared to provide grazing pasture for cattle. I’m going to be looking
  at the brown spider monkey’s use of these forest fragments, and their
  ability to move in-between them. Using this information I’ll be able
  to suggest conservation action which could alleviate the pressures
  that this species face by being confined to such small areas of
  forest.  Ill be working with Fundación Proyecto Primates, ( www.proyectoprimates.org ),
  a Colombian NGO working towards the conservation of Neotropical
  primates and their habitats. To conduct this project I need a few bits and bobs, which if I had
  the cash, would make things a whole lot easier. For instance, the area
  I aim to conduct the study in is seasonally flooded, resulting in
  these big soup bowls of swampy forest, harboring millions of
  mosquitos, which I’m not a big fan of (see pictures). If you’d be so
  kind as to donate some cash, I could afford to buy some wading
  trousers and mosquito nets for the whole team, enabling us not to
  suffer horribly whilst conducting research, allowing us to cover more
  ground and complete the project. Other funds will go towards paying
  wages for a Colombian student/research assistant, whose help will be
  invaluable, paying for transport, food etc. Basically all the
  essential stuff that allows research to happen. I’m not pretending that your hard earned money will change the world
  instantly, or that by giving 5 pounds you’ll ensure that the (in my
  opinion) majestic, fantastic and beautiful brown spider monkey will be
  saved from extinction, but it’ll make my job a whole lot easier and
  allow the project to run a bunch  smoother . ANYWHO, there’s a donate button up on the top right, if you fancy
  parting with £1 or so, I’d be truly grateful. Thanks everyone, you’re all winners. Chris",https://fundrazr.com/difC0
510,Integrate PTATs with Custom Audience,Australian Dollar,,of $400 goal,10,127%,"At ptatpage.com I've been helping people to advertise
  their business pages by providing lists of people who like or comment
  on another fan page.  Facebook calls this 'People Talking About This'
  or PTAT for short, and it's a great way of cheaply
  laser targeting leads. PTATs are awesome because you never know where a page attracts
  its likers from. They could be bought from click farms or generated by
  like ladders or anywhere that means that targeting people who like a
  page would be a waste of time or more importantly, a waste of money. By creating a way to collect just the people who are engaged in
  a product or service means that we can laser target who sees our ads.
   The effect is much cheaper advertising and generates a relevant fan
  base to generate leads. The problem with my PTAT Page service is that you have to download
  the UserId lists, then upload them into Facebook and create a custom
  audience from it.  That's too much effort, too hard, and too time consuming. What I want to do, what I'm crowd funding for, is to connect the list
  directly with your Ad Manager. To get this $400 upgrade done, means I
  can integrate lists with Facebook so the custom audience is created
  for you, in your account. This means no more downloads , just click and go and
  the system will do all the heavy lifting.  All you have to do is make
  the ad. Even if you don't mind doing the extra steps, getting this
  deal will save you a lot. What you get for participating in this crowd fund is a golden pass
  for 50 PTAT lists to use now and in the future.  On average each list
  on the site is about $3 each.  Brisbane Kids PTAT list is over $13 for
  example.  Each person who contributes $50 will be emailed a golden
  pass code to use on any PTAT List that is available now or in the
  future with no expiry date. This will save you a minimum of $100 just for helping me grow this
  site organically. I need 8 contributors to commence the first upgrade.  If this deal is
  over subscribed, I will still honor the golden pass for you, but the
  funds will be used to do the next 2 upgrades which I will also
  describe in the next fundrazr. If the fund is undersubscribed I will still honor the golden pass Thanks for your help in making this page a success, I'm looking
  forward to helping your grow your business and generate some return on investment.",https://fundrazr.com/dkHz9

120,Launch Senior Natural Health + Wellness Website,U.S. Dollar,,of $7.5k goal,5,2%,"I have launched a health and wellness website to provide education
  and tools for our aging population to live a more natural life. The
  site is be directed toward baby boomers and caretakers who provide
  care for adults of any age, but contains valuable health information
  for people of any age. I spent two months designing the site and now I am working on
  building content and spreading the word. View the site here: http://seniorhealthguru.com Inspiration I have been involved with seniors my entire working life, first as
    an elder law paralegal and now as a yoga instructor in adult foster
    homes. Working with this population brings me complete gratitude. I
    have had a number of experiences in both capacities when I wanted to
    offer a natural therapy, yet found myself biting my tongue instead
    of speaking out about alternatives to Western medicine. My parents, aunts, uncles and all of their friends are at or
    approaching retirement age and I am becoming more concerned about
    their health and wellness. The current state of “health care” (more appropriately called
    ”sick care”) in the United States is at best, uncertain. These three factors are motivating me to support our aging population
  in living in a state of optimal health. Being proactive is an essential component to this and in order
    to be proactive people need great resources, which I intend to provide. My Background I have studied health and nutrition since high school. While it was
  initially simply an “interest,” it has since then become my career. A few years ago I became very sick both physically and mentally. I
  was confined to my bed for two months and found no relief or support
  from my Western medical doctors. From this broken place, I was introduced to the holistic healing
  system of India, called Ayurveda, a sister science to yoga (literally
  translated as ""the wisdom of life"". Through it's practices I
  was able to not only heal, but became healthier in my mind, body and
  spirit than I had ever been in my life. My experience was so profound that I started a holistic health
  practice to share my knowledge. I have a blog on the website for my
  practice, and have been ghostwriting blog posts for another health
  coach for the past year. I love writing and spreading my knowledge to
  others. To find out more about me visit my holistic health practice website here . What I Need to Launch The estimated launch date is June 2014. I have several articles
  written and six months worth of article ideas drafted. Once the site
  is launched, I plan to publish articles at least two times per week
  and send out bi-weekly newsletters. To complete the launch of the website, I need funds for the following
  start-up costs: Website design Logo and branding Recipe and meal plan development Adobe Acrobat Pro software Email hosting subscription service Stock photos Advertising Initially the website will have: Healthy recipes Natural health articles (i.e. natural pain relievers, dry skin
    remedies, food and herbs for certain health imbalances, etc.) Nutritional articles Formulas for natural cleaning products for the home Guest posts from elder law attorneys and financial planners about
    healthy money management An online “shop” where I will have products that I personally recommend Senior moments – a place for readers to share their heartwarming
    stories of working with seniors ( which is how I anticipate
      readership will grow quickly ) As the site grows I would like to offer downloadable meal plans,
  e-books, e-courses, online yoga classes and a phone app. (My 95 year
  old grandpa loves his iPad!) PLEASE FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK! What You Get Everyone will have free access to all of the wonderful information on

800,"Zesty Fry Shakers - Just Say ""NO"" To Naked Fries!",U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,17,8%,"French
  Fry seasoning blends that are all natural & offer the consumer a
  healthier option without sacrificing flavor or taste. The idea for Zesty Fry Shakers came about years
    ago when I wanted to add flavor to ordinary plain French Fries for
    my four children. I wanted to add amazing flavor without adding a
    lot of extra calories or fat. I wanted the fries to have a
      kick! So, I experimented with lots of spices and
    seasonings. Finally, I came up with some enticing flavors that make
    you come back for more! We have five delicious and zesty flavors... Bacon Cheddar,
      Chili Cheese, Habanero Ranch, Jalapeno Nacho and Loaded Baked
    Potato . These flavors will entice and excite any taste
    bud...We will produce additional flavors in the future. I wanted an all natural product and I didn't want
    to use a synthetic anti-caking agent in my French Fry Seasoning
    blends, like most seasoning blends do, so I chose to go with a Natural Rice Concentrate . It costs a bit more but
    I have set a high standard for my French Fry Seasoning Blends and it
    sets me apart from any competition. We have tested our product in William Sonoma at one of their
    Artisan Markets. It's where they allow local producers the
    opportunity to set up a table in their store on Saturdays and sell
    their product. Our flavors were received extremely well. So well in
    fact, that the manager and assistant manager purchased some shakers
    for themselves. Did you know that in total Americans eat approximately 2 million
    tons of french fries every year. That's 4 billion pounds! So our slogan is ""Just Say
      ""NO"" To Naked Fries! We have chosen to do several different levels for Perks to make it
    exciting and to meet any budget. The gift basket above is included
    in the Perks starting at $50 or more... Note: The seasonings in the basket will be different as we have
    changed the bottle...but this is approximately what you will receive. The funds raised during this project will help get my website up
    and running, update the label and place our first major order with
    our supplier, as well as getting some display units to put in retail stores. Thank you very much for considering backing my project... Disclaimer: We are not affiliated with or sponsored by

  their beards the thickest they can with no timeframes in sight. Gamers Outreach is an amazing charity giving the joy of gaming for
  those less fortunate or going through a very hard stage in life. They
  have raised countless amounts of money and gaming related items, it
  was CrReam, and Vaughn’s thought of helping out the cause. Helping is as easy as stopping by the streams, tweeting out the
  fundraiser and donating! Both CrReam and Vaughn will be trying to
  stream everyday with face-cams while they grow their hairy
  masterpieces.  This event could last weeks, months and YEARS!!!
  Nevertheless, they will be recording their growth on their streams and
  Reddit. Tweeting out the streams and using the official hashtags of
  the event will spread the word and help make this event known! The Hashtags they will be using are: #BEARDOFF2014 #BeardsForGamers #TeamCrReam #TeamVaughn Donating is very much our main goal here but just support the event
  is VERY helpful. Donating can be done either on this fundrazr or
  directly to Gamers Outreach! We are hoping to donate as much as we can
  to help Gamers Outreach while growing manly face fuzz. There will also be talks about a punishment for the one who shaves
  1st. Things are in the talks but the word “Dresses” and “Make-Up” have

150,Help Leif Repair His Vehicle,U.S. Dollar,,of $1k goal,2,15%,"What happened? On May 2nd the transmission of the vehicle I have owned for the last
  9 years went out. The primary cause was the linkage cables coming off,
  preventing the manual transmission from shifting. While this was a
  fairly simple fix it wasn't the final solution. To ensure they would
  not come out again at any moment it was suggested that at the minimum
  I have the cables and clutch replaced. It was also recommended that I
  have the transmission itself repaired because between this and another
  incident a year ago it had been pretty beaten up and was grinding and
  slipping badly. The linkage cables and clutch alone would have cost at
  least $1,500 to replace, another $1,500-$2,500 for the transmission
  repair. On a car only worth about $2,000 I could not justify spending
  even the $1,500, so I chose to scrap the car. I have been blessed with
  the kindness of friends loaning me a car since then. But they often
  need it back, leaving me walking or taking public transportation. Wait a minute. Just who are you? People know me as Leif Adamson. I am an 8 year veteran of the U.S.
  Army who is rated as 90% disabled. Back in August 2013 I launched my
  own small business to try to make ends meet. It is called The Absinthe
  Guy and is a traveling bar tending service specializing in the proper
  service of and education about absinthe. So why are you asking for so much? While I have secured a replacement vehicle the costs are not over. I
  still owe $950 on the car. And there are a number of things that need
  to be done as far as repairs to get the car running well again. So any
  money gathered will be put toward the reamining balance or the repairs. If you run a business why can't you just raise it by working?
    Or finance the cost? As I mentioned my business is based on travel. And well, that just
  isn't going to happen without a vehicle. As far as financing, it just
  is not feasible at this time. I only get $1,700 a month from my VA
  disability. After rent, bills, food, and other necessities I really
  have nothing to spare each month. To be perfectly honest, if not for a
  lot of help from all my amazing friends I would go hungry for days out
  of each month. I hate that I need to keep asking for help. But until
  my VA disability is raised again or I am awarded Social Security
  Disability I really don't have anything extra. If you are disabled, where do you really need to go? I may be disabled, but I still have things I need and want to do. I
  am constantly needing to go to the VA hospital in Loma Linda for
  appointments. There are times that I have 3-4 appointments a week. I
  also do need to go shopping and run other errands. And well, I don't
  enjoy being housebound when all my friends are out doing things I
  should be participating in. I have looked into public transportation
  and other options. And for most instances it just is not feasible in
  my area. What's in it for me? Well, to be honest I don't have much to offer other than my
  gratitude. But with a vehicle I can start taking gigs for the business
  again. And if you donate and then later book me for a gig I can give
  you a discounted rate, free time, or donate a bottle of absinthe to
  your event. If you donate and later ATTEND an event I am working I can
  offer you VIP treatment, which includes front of line priviledges and
  access to my high end ""private stock"" brands that I reserve
  for myself, my closest friends, and my best customers. I will be in
  touch with all who donate to give a personal thank you and see if
  anything I can offer would interest you.",https://fundrazr.com/6mFUe

  departments. Shug the tiger has to sort all the boxes onto the correct
  pallets before the time runs out. Each level will increase in
  difficulty and speed. Power ups will be available to purchase to help
  users pass the levels more easily. A bit about me I have a beautiful wife Allison who has supported me all the way

  small food stall on a quiet street and every day she makes delicious
  dishes that she then sells to the construction workers who work on the
  lot behind her stall or to passer-byers. Often she has given me
  samples of her food. She has the gift of cooking. Everything I have
  ever tasted of her's is delicious. She, like most Indonesians work

559,"A new standard, and a new research platform!",Canadian Dollar,,of $125k goal,5,0%,"[ Not a member of the research community? Please go to our campaign for the general
    public instead. ] Whether you're a researcher, or a member of a research ethics
  committee, undoubtedly you spend hours negotiating informed
    consent document language back-and-forth every year . Worldwide, every year, researchers and research ethics
    committees spend at least a million hours negotiating informed
    consent language to describe these very same activities and
  risks . This results in many different sets of language both
  within and between research organizations to describe the very same
  things, and is not a value-added use of anyone's time . We are undertaking this project to establish a new standard and open
  source repository of informed consent language, to describe the
  activities involved in research studies, and the risks associated with
  those activities. Once established, it will permanently remove
    a million hours a year from the research ethics review process
  worldwide ; a huge improvement in the efficiency of the
  system. Further downstream, this standard can be used to
    improve the effectiveness of the informed consent process ,
  by serving as a research platform to refine the language as needed to
  ensure research participants understand it, and then to use the same
  careful process to translate these standard clauses into other
  languages, and other media such as multimedia (e.g. - animated videos). Awesome! How Can I Help? There are three ways you can help move this project forward: Share the campaign with your social networks by clicking one of
    the buttons at the top of this campaign page (just under the video). Spread our message far and wide by adding your social voice to our
      Thunderclap campaign . If our Thunderclap campaign reaches its
    goal of 100 participants, our message will be amplified when —
    simultaneously — every participant has a one-time post to his/her
    social media profile(s) about this project. Make a donation and help us reach our target by choosing one of
    the donation levels to the right of the page, and the corresponding “perk”. How Will You Use My Funds? Charting the Course: Hire a summer intern to conduct a meta-analysis of research studies Determine the most common activities in research studies Finding the Experts: Crowdsourcing of expertise Vetting of expertise Getting It Done: Bring together the experts to do this work, and compensate them
    for their time (it's going to be hard work!) Electronic platform development costs ( mostly developed
      already by Stewardly ) Nitty Gritty: Establish a non-profit organization to evolve and steward this
    standard into the future Legal costs Insurance Processing + Platform FundRazr fee PayPal/payment processing fees Every dollar raised above our goal, minus the processing and platform
  costs, will be provided directly to the newly established non-profit,
  to further this work. About the Perks for this campaign... Stewardly is greatly committed to this cause, and this project. So
    much so, that matching amounts of software credits* for use with
    Stewardly software services will be provided to all donors. Over the
    coming months, Stewardly will release a number of software services
    that will enable researchers, research ethics committees and
    research organizations to increase their efficiency and
    effectiveness with respect to the research ethics review process. *Credits are for use with Stewardly software services
    only , and are not valid towards the e-REB system offering that Stewardly has
    made available for research ethics committees in partnership with
    Fluidware. That offering includes use of the FluidReview software
    service, which Fluidware has already made available as a special
    package for research ethics committees. Who is spearheading this project? You might be wondering who thought up this project, and has been the
  driving force behind it. Josh Leslie, the founder of Stewardly shares
  a bit of his story and his reasons for undertaking this work in this
  short video: He shares some of his concerns with top-down approaches to research
  ethics streamlining in this other short video: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Q: How did you arrive at a figure of 1 million hours a year? A: A very fair question! Short answer: 500,000 for researchers (and research teams) per year, worldwide,
    in preparing the ""activities"" and ""risks""
    clauses of informed consent documents for submission to research
    ethics committees, and negotiating language for those clauses back-and-forth. 500,000 hours for research ethics committees per year, worldwide,
    in reviewing the ""activities"" and ""risks""
    clauses of informed consent documents, and negotiating language for
    those clauses back-and-forth. 400,000 hours for initial reviews of research studies 100,000 hours for reviews of amendments to research studies
          ( that affect these informed consent clauses ) Longer answer: [forthcoming ] Q: You are running 2 crowdfunding campaigns simultaneously: one for
    the research community, and one for the general public . Are
    you ""double-dipping""? A: This is a valid concern to have, but
  rest assured that this is not the case. The reason we are running 2
  campaigns simultaneously, is for two main reasons: The different communities (research vs. general public) require
    different levels of detail with respect to this project. The ""perks"" for each of these communities are different. We searched for a crowdfunding platform that would be able to support
  having the total amount raised for both campaigns roll up into an
  overall 'master' total, and thought that we would be able to
  accomplish this via FundRazr, the platform we ended up selecting.
  However, unfortunately the current FundRazr platform only supports #1
  and cannot support #2. This caused a delay in launching our campaign
  to the research community, which was an unanticipated technical issue,
  and for which we apologize. This also means that in order to keep the total in each campaign
  updated accurately, once a week we will have to manually 'sync' the
  funds raised. For the duration of both campaigns we will do this, and
  publish an update when the funds have been added. By way of concrete
  example, if $1000 is raised in one week via the general public
  campaign, we will manually add that to the total for the research
  community campaign, and then post an update letting followers of our
  research community campaign know.",https://fundrazr.com/7nO0c

790,Pay-it-Forward Mobile App,U.S. Dollar,,of $40k goal,14,2%,"Pay-it-Forward Mobile is a Smartphone application that takes
  Paying-It-Forward and charitable giving to a whole new level! This
  free application will allow subscribers to randomly Pay-it-Forward one
  dollar to someone they don’t know. Through an automated or manual
  process, the recipients reciprocate and do the same for someone else.
  The goal is to create a global network of subscribers all
  participating in, and benefiting from the Universal Law of Reciprocity
  - What Goes Around, Comes Around! This is how it works: Download the App and create a Pay-it-Forward account. Deposit $5, $10, $20 or $25 into your account. Link up with your favorite charitable organization. Through a random process, $1 is sent from your account to someone else. That member reciprocates and does the same for another member. Additional funds are generated for the user’s account through
  referrals, mobile ads, and online shopping. Over time, the initial
  small deposit grows into a larger amount which is donated to the
  user’s favorite charity. Subscribers can login and track account
  activities, connect with others, and refer the App to friends and family. The Pay-it-Forward mobile App will be available for both Apple iPhone
  and Google Android Smartphones. Future upgrades include multilingual
  format for international distribution. Our Team: We have assembled a team of volunteer app developers,
  social media professionals, and eMarketing consultants to participate
  in the development and marketing of this fundraising application. Revenue/Sustainability: The basic App is free. The program will be
  self-sustaining through revenue generated from premium upgrades,
  mobile ads, online shopping, and transaction fees. Marketing Strategy/Distribution Channels: Partnerships and
  cross-promotions will be established with non-profit organizations and
  other Pay It Forward Initiatives. Once the App development is
  complete, a branded version will be developed for youth-based
  organizations such as JA, FBLA, and DECA as a fundraiser. A co-branded
  version will be developed for large corporations that can be
  distributed to employees and customers. Launch Date: January 1, 2014 Download Projections: 1 million downloads the first year and 10
  million downloads in three years. Our objective is to make Paying-it-Forward and charitable giving a
  part our everyday experience. This can be accomplished through mobile
  and social technology that is now accessible to almost everyone all
  the time. Considering the social and viral nature of this App, it has
  the potential to grow exponentially with millions of subscribers
  raising millions of dollars for charitable organizations annually.",https://fundrazr.com/dfU75

    completed the fund raising, we can begin production phase. June - July if pre-production processing. This phase like
    everything else in life, takes time. The molds must be created,
    inspected, and approved before the manufacturing begins. Then the ""actual"" production can begin, this process
    takes approximately one month. As soon as we receive the
    ""gators"" we will get them out to you as quickly as
    possible. We will provide weekly updates as we move through the process. Our Story Generally stories begin with “Once Upon a Time” but those are fairy
  tales and this is no fairy tale. It is a tale of hard work, great
  designs, and a tremendous amount of analysis. Screamin Designs was
  born long before it was actually incorporated in June 2012. It has
  evolved into a professional E-Commerce online business with great
  products. If you want to see how we make the products, please watch
  our video. Screamin Designs produces unique three-dimensional designs of animals
  and fish. These items are for sports enthusiasts who hunt, fish, and
  enjoy sports. Our first creation is the “gator”, for those of you who
  do not use slang; this is short for “alligator”! Whether you watch
  them or hunt them, ours are great. We have a 3”, 6”, and 10”
  3-dimensional gators. The 3” and 6” are peel and stick. You can take your “gator” anyplace,
  anywhere: on your phone, your laptop, or even your car window!! We
  also have a Lil’ Gator Key Chain and coming soon is the Gator License
  Plate. You can have one anywhere you want. They are well made,
  flexible, yet durable and very colorful. We thought we would let our customers pick the colors. We have chosen
  11 different colors to start with. When you make your pledge, just
  chose the top 3 colors in order of preference. We will do our best to
  provide your first choice. We’ll also give you a sneak peek of the
  license plate covers!! We welcome your input on the colors here as well. We’ve done all our homework; we are well grounded and know how to run
  a business. We just need a little help getting started. Our gators are
  great; our hogs are wild; our ducks are down; and our fish are flashy! Once we reach our goal of $70,000 we can begin work on our other
  products, such as our hog, duck, deer, and bass. But we need your help
  – please make a pledge and help us take our business to the next
  level. Right now we are working in our garage, but that’s okay many
  businesses got their start in a garage, like Disney, Mattel and Apple
  to name a few. Wouldn’t you love to say, “I helped get Screamin

225,Reputation Can't Be Bought!,,,,,,"My name is Natalia. I am from the San Francisco Bay area and am
  currently residing in the Ukraine. It wasn’t until I came to the
  Ukraine two years ago and ran into a few incredibly stressful
  situations of being treated poorly as a customer by local businesses
  that instead of just excepting this I started to think about how I
  could make this better and the idea of creating a place where people
  could review local businesses really started working for me. In the
  United States, reputation might be somewhat obvious to most people and
  is part of doing business for most companies. As far as my story goes,
  there is no way of knowing which companies are or are not reputable
  when it comes to hiring a professional in the Ukraine and the other
  post-soviet countries in the Eastern Europe. I have realized that it
  would be nice to have such a place online where people give their
  feedback to build the reputation of the businesses about received
  services so others can make an informed decision before staying at a
  hotel, eating at a restaurant or hiring a company or a professional
  throughout the Eastern Europe. In our fast paced world most people
  want to have answers almost instantaneously. I have this vision of
  building a state-of-the-art application called ReputationTalk in both the Russian and English
  languages so that it becomes a reputable place to go for answers for
  both Americans who travel for business or pleasure and seek good
  guidance and the locals living in Ukraine and the other countries of
  the region. I am very excited about having something to build from
  scratch, here in the Ukraine first and then expanding it to the other
  countries of the post-soviet era by bringing the freedom of voicing
  their opinion to local and visiting customers along with the American
  standards of doing business. With a firm belief in the enduring value
  of reputation and the importance of having such a source of business
  pride, I would like to invite you to become a part of this endeavor.",https://fundrazr.com/3n8Q5

  than to have a loving family and a bakery where she can share her
  talent of making delicious treats that people seek out time after time. Sarah is a US Air Force veteran and is currently living in O'Fallon,
  IL.  She is a certified Special Ed teacher which has not been fruitful
  of late due to the lagging economy limiting jobs in this area.  Though
  she loves working with kids and teaching them new and exciting things,
  her passion is baking. Born and raised in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada, Sarah is the
  only daughter of four kids that were nurtured by their late mum,
  Susan.  She continues to maintain a close relationship with her
  Canadian family: stepfather Arnold and her brothers Doug, Graham and
  Logan as well as her two aunties and grandmother. Sarah longs to
  maintain her heritage by delving into culinary arts inspired by none
  other than her mum. When she's not in the kitchen creating delectable treats, she's
  caring for her husband Steven of 20 years and her three kids; Charlie
  16, Emily 14 and Joey 12.  Her whole family supports everything she
  does because it's very easy to believe in something so real.  Sarah is
  currently utilizing the local farmer's market every Saturday to
  showcase her talents and the results are outstanding (as far as
  farmer's markets go).  Every Saturday brings back loyal fans as well
  as new ones.  It's very exciting to see the expressions on customers'
  faces and the joy they proclaim as they take a bite into the treat
  they just purchased from Sarah. Her ultimate dream is to own and operate her very own bakery.  The
  opportunity in the local market to provide the product she produces is
  very attainable.  The downtown area of O'Fallon, IL is bursting at the
  seams and the locals are looking for a place with something new and
  exciting.  A place where you know that you'll never be disappointed by
  a smiling face ready to serve a tasty treat that only a true Canadian
  can make. It will be by the grace of God along with the help from a
  few friends and family that Sarah's dream will come to fruition and
  one day she will have the opportunity to hand that dream off to one of
  her own kids.  The big question that cannot be answered at this time

175,Fund Amazing Startup With Profit Option To You,U.S. Dollar,,of $35k goal,2,1%,"1. Funding stages 2. Second funding stage 3. What
    is in it for you? 4. How you can help and benefit 1. Funding stages After a lot of work, I want to startup an honest community, with its
  own payment system, own currency, profit sharing with the community,
  that will operate internationally. Therefore I need to register
  international trademarks, to make sure that others do not take them,
  to cause serious trouble. But registering international trademarks is
  expensive, and I need 5 trademarks. One can cost up to $30.000 or
  more. Because registering a trademark correctly is not as easy as you
  saw in the short video. So first I want to register trademarks for a
  few areas, starting with the Benelux area. For that and other expenses
  to prepare for ""the second funding stage"", I need about
  $35.000. Proper registrations will give me the right to register the
  trademarks internationally later, within a time frame. This is the
  first funding stage. If the funding is hopefully more, that more will go to the second
  funding stage. But if more is enough for the second funding stage,
  which includes licenses, then it can be skipped. 2. The second funding stage After applications to register the trademarks, I can publish
  everything with trademarked names for the second funding stage, to be
  more informative and therefore attractive to funders, as they will be
  better informed and see the sites. After self financing developments so far, I do not have enough funds
  left to register the trademarks and other things. As a result I cannot
  reveal the names of the business and features for funding, in order to
  avoid that others take the trademarks and cause serious trouble. All
  this was discussed with trademark specialists, in order to know all
  that is best to do in this case. US application for later is ""used based"", as in the video.
  Strange, but that's the way it is. It would be great if about $500.000 could be raised in the second
  funding stage to make a proper start. 3. What is in it for you? At crowdhelpmyzone.com/fundrazr.php, an account will be created for
  you, upon completion of your contribution. In your account you can see
  your contribution, the second funding stage, the progress, your
  community bills (CBills), and more. You will receive an email with
  your login details. From your account you can contribute, buy CBills
  and invest as often as you like. You can also earn 5% referral commission of your referrals their
  contribution or investments, with your referral link, as you will see
  in your account. So send it to friend and family, share it on social
  media and so on. Before the start of the community you will get an account at the
  payment service 100% protected against phishing, with your CBills
  delivered in it, 100% backed up by USD, against which the CBills will
  rise, as transactions grow. Then you can deposit, withdraw, spend or
  save bills. The rate is 1 CBill to 1 USD. The CBills will render an annual return of up to 15% or more. Because
  the profits will be shared with the community, based on the money in
  their accounts. So you can earn over 100% of your price for perks back
  in 3 to 5 years, after the start of the community. For example, if you take a perk of 2500 CBills at $5000, and fees are
  $295. Then $5000-$2500-$295=$2205 is added to the funding and $2500 is
  for the backing of your 2500 community bills. Because the rule is, the
  backing must always be available for the bills. Hope for many funders, because they are potential private or business
  account holders, to give the community a jump start, and enjoy the benefits. In order not to overwhelm you with information, the focus is now on
  funding the registration of the trademarks, and to keep it short. For more go here https://www.crowdhelpmyzone.com/fundrazr.php 4. How you can help funding and benefit The more people take part in the funding, the more beneficial it is
  to them and to you. To achieve that, you can activate your contacts
  and following to contribute to the funding and benefit as account
  holders, as you will benefit. You can place the link from your account on your website, emails,
  social media to drive traffic to get many referrals.",https://fundrazr.com/1pdhe

250,Help a mama leave the benefit system,Pound Sterling,,of £250 goal,10,100%,"I have been a mama for nearly 19 years.  Before that time I had been
  in full time work, often holding down 3 jobs to make ends meet.  When
  I became a mama I knew that I wanted to do what I believe to be the
  most important job in the world - a 24/7 mama to my children. Even though my wonderful husband has worked oh so hard in full
  time employment, including 10 years on the night shift, we have
  struggled and have had many years of scrimping here and trying to save
  a few pennies there.  In our 19 years of marriage we haven't had a
  holiday or been able to afford a decent car, we rarely have luxuries
  or treats.  We don't smoke, we don't drink, all our money is put
  towards keepig the roof over our heads, paying the bills and food.  I
  have decided enough is enough, my children deserve better than just
  existing on the bare necessities. With this at the forefront of my mind I am setting up my own business
  and am willing to do whatever it takes to make it work - including
  putting out the begging bowl to get it off to a decent financial
  footing. I am going to scrub toilets for a living - well not just
  toilets, I'm going to clean homes.  I am going to offer a
  comprehensive cleaning and pet care service, offering unique services
  like 'help a mama' where a new mama is taken care of in those
  important first days of bonding.  I am not afraid of hard work and I
  have many years of cleaning experience behind me.  I believe I am good
  with people and have the necessary skills to make this work. If I am fortunate enough to raise any money through this campaign it
  will be put towards equipment and the basic necessities, as well as
  the all important marketing and advertising.  I need a nice (but
  cheap!) suit for making initial contact with my clients and for
  networking situations - I haven't worn anything like that since having
  a baby!  I don't even own a smart pair of shoes. If you can spare any amount, no matter how small you think it
  is, believe me when I say it will mean the world to me.",https://fundrazr.com/1q4Fc

  struggle trying to get the channel out to the masses. I have a ball making an producing the videos for my Youtube channel.
  My crew is excellent and dedicated. But it's still hard to do what we
  love and get what we need to keep doing this all the time. So with
  your help, any donations can matter! Everything from helping my crew
  and I get the proper equipment to money to help with Advertising. (New mics...(Audio Technica 20/20 mics) for everyone in the crew so
  they all sound better. Better computer (Alienware or a high
  performance computer) so making videos are faster and easier to make.
  Better editing program (Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas) I want to try and
  get the best capture card (Elgato HD) so my videos are more clean and
  better HD. Also the donations can goto advertising certain videos I
  have been producing like the Grease Re-creation. To bring more
  awareness to these type videos which in turn brings in more
  Subscribers and views to help the channel grow and earn money. Also
  advertising  through Facebook (Starts at $20 a day for 25-100 people
  reached) and other social media outlets. So it's easier to get my
  channel out to newer people. Cause to do so on these outlets cost
  money to start and keep going. Also the donations can help go into
  T-shirts and other merch like custom controllers to help bring funds
  back into the channel. Also donations can go into buying prize packs
  for when my Channel holds contests for the subscribers. Which in turn
  brings in more viewers and such. Cause who dont like winning merch!) I will not lie. I want to make this into a career. I want to be like
  some of the great Gaming Youtubers like Speedyw03, Vanossgaming,
  Pewdiepie. (These Youtubers plus more, make millions a year) It will
  take time and dedication. But my Crew and I are determined to bring
  entertainment like the names I have just mentioned above. But when
  starting out, you make nothing, and it can take months to years before
  the channel takes off and is self sufficent. So for now, my Crew and I
  are struggling. Most struggling artists deal with this. So please

295,Opening an own creative atelier,Euro,,of €7k goal,7,4%,"My name is Tanya Ivanova. I got involved into jewelry design back in
  2011. Today as I have quite some jewels created I need to take the
  next step - to open an attelier and a small exposition space. This is
  the purpose of the present campaign. I work with semiprecious stones, pearls, different crystal elements,
  including Swarovski crystal, beads and create unique and memorable
  designs. I am trying to create an own brand, TH Jewels, to make it
  possible to unite my works and to make them easily recognizable. The story behind my jewelry design orientation in fact is a story of
  self-reinvention. After 11 years dedication to the IT industry, I felt
  I was missing living. Virtual world is good, however the real one is
  in a way more important. So I started looking and I ocassionally
  participated in a bracelet making workshop. After it finished, I knew
  I had found what I was looking for. The rest is learning, practicing,
  making and destroying as many times as needed to achieve the best
  result possible. Today I am almost 37, I have a little daughter,
  and am trying to complete this big change in my life. Having my own
  place to create and expose my works is vital for me, because I've got
  much more to offer as a jewelry designer than I had as a web designer. I need the amount of 7000 euros to hire the place I've chosen
  and to get all the licences necessary for this new business activity.
  As I have everything else already prepared, including the furniture,
  the tools, the materiales and the initial pieces to put into the
  exposition area, I just need the space and the documentation to have
  it all legitimate. This is where your help is needed and highly appreciated. Some of the designs I have can be seen in my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/THJewels Some of
  the current products available in the e'shop here: http://www.thjewels.com Each one of the perks offered will lead to its full description
  in the website of TH Jewels. Bigger pictures, zoom option to view the
  details and possible opinions will be found there. However, as the
  campaign is aimed to be fundraising, I'd appreciate claims to be made
  here and not directly in the online shop. The perk values given
  here have little o no difference to the prices already announced in
  the website, however, having in mind that all figures here have
  the delivery included, this gives an important advantage to the

"6,063",SOMO Leadership Labs is having a bake sale!,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,26,6%,"The world is changing at a fast pace—in education, politics,
  healthcare, even the institution of marriage. How can we help people
  remain sane and kind through the tumult of uncertainty? How do we help people step into leadership in co-designing the best
  possible future for themselves and others? How can we help people
  choose to perceive opportunities, not threats, in these change
  processes -- which ultimately serve to increase their and others’ wellbeing? We help people become mindful of thinking patterns and become more
  effective change-agents in their networks. By leveraging
  SOcial-eMOtional Leaders within social and professional networks – and
  giving them learning lab experiences to build psychological muscle –
  we effect positive and sustainable changes in how people think and
  behave that extend back to the leaders’ work groups, families, and
  regions, giving lots of people SO’MO of what they want in life. Louis Alloro had a vision for the impact of intentional and
  relational leadership fifteen years ago when he was teaching high
  school English. There, he saw many students not feel good about who
  they were. It reminded him of his own high school experience. But from
  this side of the desk, he had a different vantage point and identified
  an epidemic of sorts. When he looked into some of those students’
  lives, he found dysfunctional families. It was the first time he
  looked at his family and thought, “Oh, boy – we can do better.” Thus, hatched a deep desire to influence change--at home first. Years
  later, in discovering the scientific and professional movement called
  positive psychology, he thought, “This is it! Unless we really

570,Please Help Dorta Family - For Frances' Headstone,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.3k goal,5,44%,"This story started three months ago but really began 32 years ago as
  one family member left us.  Frances Ortiz Dorta was a mom, a wife, a
  sister and a daughter who left this earth way too soon and who I never
  had the pleasure of meeting.  She was my father Jose's niece, whom he
  loved dearly.  That's how I heard about her.  Three months ago a
  chance encounter on facebook, took me back to my teenage years when I
  used to hear my father talk about her.  This is where the new chapter
  begins.  This divine appointment led me to send a message to a person
  I have never met, Frances' son, Gabriel and with that chance encounter
  also came a deep sense of wanting to do something for this person I
  never met. I believe that God brings people into our lives sometimes for a
  season, others for a reason.  The bible says in Ecclesiastes 4:9-12
  (NLT), ""Two people are better off than one, for they can help
    each other succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and
    help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble.....A person
    standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand
    back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a
    triple-braided cord is not easily broken"". So in memory
  of my wonderful dad who would have given his last penny to a stranger
  (and often did) I am asking MY family, Rivas,
  Santiago, Ortiz, extendend family and family in Christ to help me
  honor my cousin Frances by helping her children give her a proper
  headstone that will be a tribute to the beautiful person she was.  I
  know I can count on my family.  We can do this together.  God bless

255,Help us save lives!,Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,2,3%,"Who is Citizen Ticket? Citizen Ticket is a privately owned Canadian company that strongly
  believes in being open, honest and innovative in our approach to
  advocating improved road safety. We have developed an engaging web and mobile application for
    reporting unsafe and aggressive driver behaviour (and one that
    rewards safe behaviour as well). The objective is to reduce
  road user fatalities and serious injuries. By using license plates as
  the mechanism for reporting, and our unique scoring system called PlateScore , the app targets a
  driver’s anonymity and the unsafe behaviours that drivers exhibit
  because of it. We strongly believe that by removing anonymity, and
  gradually changing how drivers think when they drive, it is possible
  to drive with more awareness and more appreciation for the lives of
  others. PlateScore allows for this change to be sustainable
    and personal for each individual driver. Citizen Ticket is not associated with any police service or insurance
  agency. It is not a forum to report collisions, or rant, vent or
  distress about driving or for reporting inconsequential things people
  do on the road. It is about saving lives through long-term
  transformational change. Why are we doing this? We are doing this for one simple reason – to save lives. We know
  that fewer collisions on our roads, including those involving
  vulnerable road users, equals less fatalities and serious injuries. In 2011, over 2000 road users died in Canada. We will
    continue to advocate for improved road safety until that number is zero. Why support us? At this time Citizen Ticket offers a fully functioning live version
  of our website at http://citizenticket.ca . It is
  ready to use and functions very well, however up to this point we have
  bootstrapped the development and legal costs involved with the
  company. We hope that with your support we can continue our work and
  will be able to meet the following milestones: Finish developing and launch the hands-free mobile version of our
      reporting system. Finish developing PlateShare, which will give our users the
      ability to add multiple license plates and drivers to their
      account. As administrators, this will give parents or fleet owners
      the capacity to monitor their children or drivers while on the
      road and apply any reports to a plate and/or driver’s PlateScore accordingly. Ramp up and launch strategic marketing campaigns to get our
      message out there and build a strong user base that is committed
      to supporting our cause for safer roads in Canada and beyond. How you can support us? We will of course be very grateful and offer a sincere thank
    you for anything that you contribute; every dollar helps us and our
    cause. If you're unable to contribute with any hard earned
  dollars, we understand. Help our cause by connecting with us on social
  media or simply tell your friends and family about us. At this time we have put a couple of perks together. You do
    not have to select one of these or contribute these
  amounts. It is up to you how to support our cause if you wish
  to do so. Changemakers support us by contributing $10 or more Road Safety Heroes support us by contributing $50 or more

  launch shortly in Northern Ontario, specifically serving the North Bay
  and Timmins area. What we are looking to do is to infuse the world of
  Design with the Event Planning world to offer our clients an inclusive
  experience. Giving clients a quick cross-market will allow them to
  stay in one location without running to various others for services. This isn't the only unique service we will offer, we are also
  purchasing a laser engraver to create REAL WOOD invitations, business
  cards, postcards or whatever may be of interest. We will offer both
  engraved wood and ink stamped wood. Being able to offer this fun and
  unique alternative in Northern Ontario is something we know will be
  well received. Allowing clients to create unique wedding invitations
  that will be treasured forever or a business card that will leave a
  lasting impression, we want to be able to bring that unique twist to
  you. We have also partnered with a printer to offer a full line of
  printed items to cater to every need you may have. Our events team also plans on offering a very magical service,
  character birthdays! With various options you are sure to find the
  party that will meet your financial needs. These parties will launch
  with “Fairy Godmother” parties, allowing the birthday goers to have
  their own Fairy Godmothers for the day to play games, read stories, do
  crafts and even get a little Fairy Godmother makeover of their own.
  Characters will launch as the service expands. Services like this are
  widely available in Southern Ontario, but rarely seen up North, which
  is why we want to bring a little magic to you. We are also striving to offer competitive pricing as well as
  upfront pricing. Most services require you to contact them for quotes,
  etc. Our plan is to simply post our rates and the services offered and
  then customize from there if need be. Since the majority of services can be offered via our website
  through email correspondance, it allows us to work with people all
  over the North! Travelling to our clients in Northern Ontario will
  also be introduced for Event Planning keeping our spectrum broad as
  well. Now that you know about the business, why not tell you a little
  more about us! Stacey Future Owner/Design Manager Hi everyone! My name is Stacey and I live in Porquis Junction,
  Ontario. I am recently married and have actually just recently moved
  to where I am currently living, given my husband's promotion at work.
  I have always carried an interest and persued my artistic talent, most
  recently getting a Diploma with Honours in Graphic Design, sponsored
  by the Metis Nation of Ontario. Being Metis has had a big impact on both my art and my life as a
  whole. This is why I chose the name ""Infinite Blend"" for the
  company. Taking the symbol of the Metis people, the infinity sign, and
  creating a more swirl-look to introduce the ""blend"" to it
  made the company logo what it is today. For the name, keeping with the infinity theme, I chose the word
  ""Infinite"", also introducing the idea to our clients that we
  will create what it is they are looking for and the word
  ""Blend"" as we will be blending services as well as the
  overall design inference as well. The ideas came so fluidly as far as
  the business went, I felt it was truly meant to be. Melissa Future Event Manager/Coordinator My name is Melissa Lafrance working along with Stacey, sharing
  the same passion and and creative touch, I am Infinite Blend. A little about myself, I have three beautiful children who are my
  world and my reason for life. They offer me creativity every day and
  fuel my desire to succeed. Having worked with children in the past and
  the combination of my own, I am current with a lot of the trends kids
  follow. I am anxious to bring the magic of our parties and future
  event services to you. Why we need you Why are we looking for your help? As Metis women in Northern
  Ontario, we do have access to grants, most of them require at least a
  25% to 50% contribution on our part. So we thought, why not attempt to
  raise as much of the funds as we could, perhaps not even requiring
  grant applications, with some fun perks? This led us to our desicion
  to launch this campaign. Though we do have most of our technology
  covered thanks to it being provided through Stacey's Metis Nation of
  Ontario funded college program, there are still a few items we need.
  We also want to be able to have our laser engraver and stock on hand
  so we can start that service as soon as we launch. Being that we also
  want face to face customers to get the best understanding of services,
  we require samples and swatch books, and the cost can add up quite quickly. As you can see, our logo is an infinity symbol, influenced greatly by
  the Metis culture, being it's representative symbol. The Metis
  culture, an Aboriginal entity in Canada, is rich in inclusion being
  that we are descendents of a “mixed” nature. Being unique is in our
  blood, so integrating it into our business model was very easy for us.
  This also had an influence to share our story in this unique manner,
  being able to not only share our story to inspire fellow
  Metis/Aboriginal women in Northern Ontario, but also to inform the
  online world in general about our heritage. Looking for something cool for helping us? When we decided to do
  this, we decided to launch a Limited Edition version of our logo on a
  bunch of fun stuff. This logo will not be reproduced again after this
  campaign wraps, it will be limited to the perks in this campaign and
  be representative of the ""Original Backers"" of our company.
  It will be displayed on our site/in our offices in the future as
  representative of this as well, but never reproduced on anything else.
  So rest assured that you can sport your logo and our clients will know
  you had a big hand in our making! Perks $5 – Sticker : Get a Glossy sticker you can put
  anywhere! It has our Limited Edition logo. $25 – T-shirt with our Limited Edition logo : That's

210,Help Open The Urban Dog!,U.S. Dollar,,of $12k goal,6,2%,"A
  little over a year ago while working as a dog walker and pet sitter to
  pay for my education as a professional trainer and behaviorist, I
  realized a few things very quickly. Number one was there are a lot of
  dogs that are bored to the point of destruction, Number two is
  separation anxiety is a huge thing in the city, and Number three there
  are very few places to bring your dog in a city already plagued with
  limited green space, and even fewer ""off-leash"" areas. As an alternative to the de-facto dog parks and rough, and often
  hazardous city streets we came up with The Urban Dog - Playground and
  Agility Center. Imagine a indoor space you can bring your canine, with a full agility
  | obstacle course, enrichment puzzles, toys, and more! A place for
  owners to connect, hangout, and let their dogs socialize, and play off
  leash in play groups, no matter the weather conditions outside! A
  place to go and attend a workshop or training class, host or support
  an event to support the many amazing animal rescue groups in our city,
  or just come play! Now you have the opportunity to be a part of it
  from the beginning and we can't do it without your help! With the
  support of our friends, family, and community we can get our doors
  open, and provide a clean, fun, and safe alternative to the de-facto
  areas and often unkept dog runs. That isn't all though. Being a part of, and supporting the community
  is extremely important both as a small business owner and resident.
  After a year of planning, meetings, and much research The Urban Dog
  will be forming a Non-Profit subsidiary along side the indoor
  playground and agility center. Our mission is simple, To provide the
  resources, and service to low income, seniors, and the residents of
  Baltimore City and their canines in need to prevent, and reduce
  shelter surrenders, lower recidivism rates, and prevent unnecessary euthanasia. With an indoor playground and agility center you get all the benefits
  of going out to a dog park for exercise and training without all the
  crap, [Literally!] and much more! This isn't a place to bring your dog
  to poop on a cold winters day (although we understand accidents will
  happen) but a place for dog owners and their canines to come
  socialize, exercise, practice a skill, or participate in the myriad of
  classes workshops, and services we will offer. Urban herding anyone?
  As a friend put it after hearing about our mission, ""It's like a
  community center and gym for canines."" A portion of all of our
  profits from the indoor playground and agility center will go to
  further the mission of our non-profit. We have set a goal of $12,000 to help us in the final stages and get
  our doors open before the new year and the cold truly sets in. The
  money will be used to help finalize and secure our space, help with
  the purchase of the agility and obstacle course equipment, as well as
  licensing, gear, and anything else that inevitably pops up while we
  get our doors open. The money raised will be combined with personal
  savings, and private donations to get us open and all money raised
  through this campaign and what we do with it will be published in our
  progress reports found on our blog at www.theurbandogbaltimore.com/urbandogblog We have awesome perks for our contributors with designs, and gear
  that will only be available during this campaign. From t-shirts for
  both you and your canine, sweatshirts, bandanas, custom gear bags,
  artwork, invites to our exclusive membership club, goodie bags, and
  much much more! By
  contributing to this campaign, you will be not just gaining an awesome
  place to bring your canine, but you are also supporting the animal
  community by helping those who need it through our non-profit. If you want to support this project but aren't able to make a
  contribution right now, you can still help! Please share this with
  your friends and family on social media, and spread the word! Supporting our efforts get you involved in our already awesome
  community, supports those who need it, when they do, and gets you a
  bunch of cool stuff too! Not in the area but want to support? We've got you covered! All of
  our perks and giveaways for contributors are available to you whether

  especially when our commitment to organic & local is not fully
  recognized. So we get by on a tight budget.  But we know there’s an
  absolute army of you out there who value what we value, so we want you
  to collaborate with us on our next project!... but don't worry, we
  don't want donations. What's Next You may not know this, but we have as much space upstairs at Graze as
  we do downstairs, just begging to be put to its best use. We're
  extremely excited to announce that work has begun to develop our
  upstairs into an entirely new dining experience for Vancouver with a
  concept that you’re going to love!!  Of course, we need additional
  funds to make it great, so read on. For much of the year it’s too cold & wet to dine outside, so
  we’re bringing the outside inside. It’s a food truck stand with plenty
  of picnic table seating alongside an elevated grassy meadow, yes grassy , where you’ll eat at low tables while sprawled out on
  pillows or against a log. There’s a performance stage and a welcoming
  bar with craft beer & summer cocktails to help you enjoy a day in
  the park… all year long. Our indoor food truck, taking up one entire end of the room,
  will offer delicious veggie street food from around the world, and
  changing it up every 6-8 weeks. Projected on the enormous wall at the
  other end of the room will be video scenery to match the cuisine. So,
  in January, when we’re serving Jamaican patties with fried plantains,
  or curried veg on rice with jerk corn-on-the-cob, you’ll be kicking
  back with a rum punch and good friends next to palm trees swaying on
  the sandy beach as the sun sets over Montego Bay… to live music by
  candlelight under twinkling stars. Then it's onto Thailand, Mexico, Greece, Indonesia, Ecuador,
  Morroco, Italy, India… and why not a loaded veggie burger & yam
  fries on sunny Jericho Beach in February!?! What's Needed & How To Help Without your solidarity, this just won’t happen. But rather than
  asking for donations, we will match your dollars loaded onto your own
  ‘Graze Card’ or 'Graze Gift Card', with increasingly fun perks &
  bonuses at higher pre-purchase levels.  We also have products &
  classes you've been asking us for, fantastic private dining events and
  gulf island getaways, too! Your Graze card will be good for either
  downstairs or upstairs, and you'll be able to use it from the day we
  open the upstairs room. We have faith that you're ready for this playful new concept and
  will support the values you hold dear.  If you're a foodie - if you're
  a dreamer - if you believe in conscientous dining, please join this
  campaign to save summer so we can continue to support so many other
  great causes. If you’ll dig deep with us and pay it forward, in return
  we’ll give you great value & raise the bar on experiential dining
  in our city. If you haven't yet experienced Graze, visit our website: www.grazerestaurant.ca (Once you've saved summer with us, please consider browsing
    Fundrazr.com for a serious cause that resonates with you.  We want
    your collaboration, some others need your help.)",https://fundrazr.com/dpJka
100,Help me to create a useful radio for the youth,Euro,,of €11k goal,3,1%,"Hi, my name is Thierry FOMEJU, I am a 28 year-old engineer from
  Cameroon. Born in Douala in 1986, it is between West and Central
  Africa that I obtained a professional high school diploma, specialized
  in mathematics and civil engineering. Then, in Burkina Faso, I
  obtained a professional BA in Hydraulic Engineering and Rural
  Equipment at the International Institute of Water and the Environment
  (2IE - Institut Internationale de l'Eau et de l'Environnement). After
  two months spent working on hydraulic drilling sites, I got hired by a
  multinational firm in the construction industry where I worked for
  four years, in between East and Central Africa. A few months ago, while everything was going well for me, I became
  unemployed overnight (budgetary cuts, they say). First, I decided to
  get back on my feet by contacting some old colleagues. However, it was
  in vain. That is when I told myself that I had to take matters into my
  own hand if I wanted to get out of this bad situation. I put together
  the savings that I had left after my weeding (it is while I was on a
  leave for my wedding that I was cowardly evicted from the company) and
  I decided to launch my own company.When I told a the idea to a few
  friends who are in the same situation as I am, they responded “This is
  complete madness, the business sphere is way too complicated!” Unlike my friends, I always had a major interest for finances and I
  was convinced that my idea could evolve into something interesting. At
  first, I wanted to invest in African street art that I have always
  loved and that is now experiencing a spectacular expansion. However,
  while observing all these young people that were spending their days
  at the bars, wasting their money and their talent, I told myself that
  there was something to do to change this situation. I knew that if
  this activity was all they had left to do, it was mostly because the
  Government of Cameroon has not designed any policy that would inform
  the youth in a massive way of all the opportunities available…This is
  how the concept NEW AFRICA Station came to life. NEW AFRICA Station (N.A.S.) aims at two things: ( 1 ) becoming the
  first platform for communicating information to the youth in terms of
  contests, higher education, job offers, economy, forums and
  conferences, meetings etc.; and ( 2 ) becoming the first media
  platform for the creative youth to showcase their talents (artists,
  innovators, entrepreneurs…). In addition N.A.S. will provide the space
  to all the actors that contribute to the economic sector of the
  country (taxi drivers, artisans, vendors in the informal sector…)
  through on the ground reports where we would give them the opportunity
  to explain us what a day in their lives look like. N.A.S. will
  contribute the creation of real network that will facilitate
  information exchange as well, through a smartphone app amongst other
  things. In brief, through NEW AFRICA Station all the young people in
  Cameroon will be connected in real times with all the dimensions that
  will make up tomorrow’s world. Why a radio ? For two reasons (1) Because in Africa radio is still
  the preferred media of young people after the television, and (2) The
  majority of the African population is young. In Douala (the economic
  capital of Cameroon), 75% of the inhabitants are less than 30 years
  old!!! Yet, there are no radios that have programs that can keep the
  youth interested for more than 45 minutes (mainly those are
  Hip-hop/Rap shows between 5-6pm). Instead radios largely prefer themes
  such as the static politics of Africa, religion that anesthetize the
  spirit, the long debates on soporific topics leading to no outcome! In
  the meantime, polls clearly show that this youth, dominant in numbers
  and full of talent, only want the attention to refocused on them and
  on what young people are doing every day out of the spotlight, to
  reverse the situation and build a better Cameroon. I am working on the
  project with my wife, my sister and a few Cameroonian artists who
  found it interesting. For instance there is TAKUS KIZER, a dance hall
  artist; ARMEL who just signed with Akon’s label after he did a cover
  of his famous song Mulema ( Armel's video link ). I could not forget to
  mention HOT MONEY, our DJ and singer ( Hot Money's myspace link ). Many others are here,
  supporting us (inventors, geeks, entrepreneurs, small retailers…),
  waiting to share their passion and know-how. Akon and Armel in Senegal As of today, I have already put together all the equipment that will
  allow me to emit on FM, as well as the major part of the equipment for
  the production. All this have cost 13,696 euros. If I am asking for
  help, it is essentially for: - the installation of the equipment by a team of professionals (3,048
  euros) - setting up the premises (9,200 euros) - developing an android app with our Ivorian partners (1,600 euros) - a small surplus that would allow to get the business going an face
  any unplanned expenditures Office before development Office after development I ordered the equipment from a French company based in Nice called
  ELETEC SARL. The head of the sales department is M. Pierre Luc
  Charvin. His phone number is +33 (0)493019999 and his email address is
  sales@broadcasteletec.com He will confirm you that the equipment has
  been entirely paid and will be shipped over in mid-November. Bill of material If ever the crowdfunding goes over my expected goal, which I truly
  hope it does, the surplus will help me to simply create additional job positions: 1 cleaner 1 part-time security guard 1 driver that would drive our teams for the on the ground reports and
  also during the night . This surplus could also contribute to launching the future expansion
  of the NEW AFRICA Station: the NEW AFRICA Records!",https://fundrazr.com/atp3b

"2,005",Help us clean India,U.S. Dollar,,of $2k goal,43,100%,"Amritha Subramanian and I are Columbia University graduate students
  and we are raising money to launch our socially minded business,
  Sarvada, which will introduce source-separation of household waste
  into the existing Indian waste management system. If segregated properly, the average household waste can earn up to
  $50 annually - to put things into perspective, the per capita annual
  income of India is $1500. Apart from the obvious financial boost, proper waste management can
  result in cleaner streets and elevated living conditions. Our operational plan is simple : Step 1 : Get households to separate their waste into recyclables,
  organics and inerts. Step 2 : Process the separated waste - recyclables go to recycling
  facilities, organics get vermi-composted, inerts go to landfills. Step 3 : Share a portion of the revenue that comes from recycling and
  compost sale with the households, thereby giving them a financial
  incentive to participate in the program. And yes, this keeps us
  financially sustainable as well! This December, we are launching our pilot on a small scale in
  Kanchipuram, which is a small city in the southern part of India. We
  have estimated our setup and operational expenses to be about $2,000.
  We are planning to sign up 50 households and run the whole operational
  process end-to-end. We invite you to be a part of this campaign and any financial help
  you can provide will go a long way in realizing our dream of cleaning
  our India. Lets do it together and give our children a clean, green India!",https://fundrazr.com/0tAIc
253,Vegan Sushi in Peru!,U.S. Dollar,,of $50k goal,2,1%,"Pick up your gift card and drop by, or send it to an adventurous
  friend traveling in Peru! Pre-opening we will treat you (or them) to a
  tasty vegan meal and drinks on our terrace over-looking the river,
  while watching the sunset colour Chichani in the background. Having been vegetarian for 30 years and having travelled throughout
  Latin America for quite a few of those years, I've eaten in a ton of
  restaurants and developed a fine sense of what it a customer
    likes and needs .  I'm now ready to use these experiences to
  help vegan, vegetarian and flexetarian travellers have an
  unforgettable experience! I'm from Vancouver (with a dutch-canadian background) and my business
  partner is from Arequipa, Peru. For years I lived in Vancouver's hip
  Commerical Drive neighbourhood and often took advantage of the areas
  many, many restaurants. Then, a couple of years ago, I gained
  experience in actually running a restaurant. While travelling in
  Nicaragua I tripped over a vegetarian restaurant on Ometepe Island.
  During a period of 15 months, I turned the place around, from barely
  hanging on into one of the most popular dining
  destination s on the island. I see exciting opportunities to
  do something similar in Arequipa. The plan is to start small, with a cool little sushi
  bar centrally located where travellers and locals meet. In addition to
  a select and affordable menu of Japanese-Peruvian dishes we will bring
  in local musicians and artists .
  After some time, the concept will expand to include other Asian
  vegetarian traditions and other cities in Peru and even throughout
  Latin America. But first we need to get our foot in the door, and
  that's where you can help. We need to build a strong, enthusiastic team and
  negotiate a prime location. We need to navigate Peruvian bureaucratic
  hurdles. We are raising a bit of cash to pay the bills for the next
  few months so we can concentrate on those challenges. Between leasing
  a space, buying equipment and supplies, hiring a chef, and legalities,
  we need $5000. In March, we will welcome our supporters to Arequipa. Dinner and
  drinks are on us! Our focus is on customer service, unlike our
  competitors who focus on trying to extract the maximum tourist dollars
  with the minimum effort. This will not be a tourist trap!",https://fundrazr.com/atQP9
710,Join the Gone Sailing Team and Enjoy a New Yacht,Canadian Dollar,,of $295k goal,5,0%,"Gone Sailing Adventures is ready to grow, and I
  want to share its future success with you.  With your support, we can
  upgrade the fleet with a new yacht to improve customer experience. Here's how we got here.... I started sailing at Camp Northland, near Halliburton, Ontario, when
  I was 11. I loved the water, the wind, and the science and art of
  combining the two. I continued sailing during my teens, taught sailing
  each summer through high school, and eventually moved up to larger
  boats, obtaining my Sail Canada, Keel Boat Cruising instructor’s
  certification.  In 2008, I lost my job during the financial crisis and
  spent the summer teaching sailing. It was then when I saw an amazing
  opportunity for a sailing tour business in Toronto. The only problem
  was that I didn't have a boat. Two years later, I was given an opportunity: a friend rented me his
  boat (BetteK) for 20 days to ""test the waters."" The concept
  was a success, and over the next four years the business grew to the
  point where I am now committed to it full time. From its start in
  2010, running introductory sails, Gone Sailing
  Adventures now offers a full complement of sailing
  experiences, including group sails, special event sails, wine sails to
  Niagara Vineyards (coming 2015), private charters, lessons,
  winter Caribbean cruising and a Yacht
  Time membership base who utilize luxury Beneteau Yachts
  all summer long. There would have been no business without the generosity of a friend,
  and I’ve never forgotten being given that start. I have been teaching at Blind Sailing Association of
  Canada (BSAC) for the last 4 years; they provide sailing
  experiences to visually impaired persons, giving them the freedom to
  choose and control their own course on the water. Last summer we held
  a special sailing event for BSAC on Father’s Day weekend, offering
  discounted 1hr sails to the public and donating all proceeds to this
  great organization. We also support charities across Toronto through
  donations of gift certificates. Our sailing experiences on Lake
  Ontario are a unique experience that generate great returns in charity
  auctions and raffles. In appreciation for your contributions we’ll
  be giving away 2 midweek 3hr sailing experiences, to a maximum of 50
  gift certificates (valued at $12,500). I’m proud of what we’ve built, and what we contribute back to
  Toronto, but it’s time for us to grow, and we want you to get involved! I invite you to jump
  on board and be a part of the success of this exciting venture. The original boat I started with is ready to be retired. To help
  raise capital for a new yacht, I decided to reach out and offer others
  an opportunity like I was provided back in 2010. Why get involved? The first 50 contributors before December 15, 2014 will receive **BONUS PERKS**. - First, for your own experience and enjoyment: Your contribution
  will entitle you to perks that will allow you, your family, your
  friends, your company or your clients to enjoy your investment

"2,900",Hjälp oss rädda Lanthandeln!,Swedish Krona,,of kr150k goal,6,2%,"I april 2012 satsade vi all tid och våra besparingar på att väcka liv
  i en nedlagd lanthandel. Vår vision var att skapa en social träffpunkt
  för vårt lilla samhälle i Stora Mellby utanför Sollebrunn. Vi ville
  att byn skulle ha en egen butik, ett café och lunchrestaurang. Sedan
  maj 2014 har vi också en Pub. I september i år blev min man svårt sjuk. På vårdcentralen trodde man
  att han fått halsfluss, och han skickades hem med en ask tikacillin. 4
  dagar senare hade en böld bildats under hakan och min man ringde till
  vårdcentralen och bad att få komma igen, eftersom det inte kändes
  normalt för en halsfluss. - Du får inte komma hit förrän du ätit upp ditt penicillin, svarade
  sköterskan. På kvällen brast bölden. Ett 8 centimeter brett öppen sår,
  där varet rann ner över bröstet. Hela huset stank kadaver! Det blev akut intag på NÄL och läkarna opererade honom tre (3!)
  gånger samma natt, eftersom varet spred sig och huden fick klippas
  bort successivt. Han låg nersövd med respiratior i tre dygn och de var
  osäkra på om han skulle klara sig. Han berättar att han såg ljuset i
  tunneln, men läkarna gav honom hjärtstimulerande medel och han återvände. Sviterna efter denna sjukdom innebär att han har fått transplantera
  ett stycke hud från låret till halsen. Han orkar inte mycket så vi har
  fått ha butiken stängd på eftermiddagarna. På förmiddagen har vi hjälp
  av en god vän, som håller fart i luncherna och ser till butiken. Problemet är nu att försäljninen har sjunkit drastiskt.Vi har inte
  fått in det vi behöver för att täcka våra kostnader, och vårt mål för
  denna höst var att utöka sortimentet och marknadsföra oss alltmer för
  att vi ska kunna driva denna servie vidare. Jag har under denna tid arbetat vid sidan om butiken, eftersom den
  inte har givit någon lön till någon av oss. Min man är nu hemma utan
  rätt till ersättning från försäkringskassan. Jag försöker hinna med
  att serva butiken på kvällarna. eftersom jag arbetar heltid borta så
  är det inte möjligt för mig att sköta butiken dagtid. Varje fredag har
  jag puben öppen till kl 01:00 och på lördag öppnar vi kl 9:00 med
  frukostservering. Vi har inte råd att anställa någon som kan hoppa in. Så vi hoppas med denna sida att vi ska få ert stöd, som läser detta.
  Vi behöver kapital till att öka sortimentet i butiken, råd att
  tillfälligt anställa någon vikarie och att marknadsföra oss för att
  fler ska hitta hit. Vi måste dessutom byta kyldiskar eftersom de gamla
  har gått sönder. Du som tycker att servicen på landet är viktig, du som gillar
  lokalproducerat, ekologiskt, personlig service och tycker det är
  viktigt att aven de små företagen ska kunna överleva och att de små
  företagarna ska kunna bli sjuka utan att stå helt barskrapade, hjälp oss! På vårt PayPalkonto kan du sätta in ditt bidrag. Som tack skickar vi
  en mugg med vår logga som ett bevis för din hjälp.",https://fundrazr.com/8ubq5
906,machinePod 442 | a CNC Makerspace in Toronto,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,4,9%,"Welcome to machinePod 442. The wotzBotz machinePod is a makerspace concept built around access
  to high performance CNC and related equipment that would be difficult
  or impossible for most people to have at home - either because it
  costs too much, or because they simply don't have the space to put it.
  One thing that separates a machinePod from other makerspaces with a
  CNC machine is that the Pod is fully supervised. We check over all
  your programs and setups before you run the machine, and keep and eye
  on things as they run. This is part of all memberships and has no
  extra fee. If you need more help than a basic setup check, we can also
  provide you with pro level CNC and CAD services for a very modest fee. machinePod 442 is our first space, located at the intersection of
  Queen and Dufferin Streets in downtown Toronto, and will open in
  January 2015. We hope to pack this location with enough goodies to
  make virtually any small building project possible, and some large
  ones too! Whether it's an exotic wood coffee table or a billet
  aluminium Han Solo blaster replica, we aim to have you covered. We are
  also set up for Workshop classes, long term group projects, and CNC
  service providing. This Fundrazr page is to help raise about $10000 to ensure we open in
  January fully ready to go, with wall and lights and everything! It's
  also a convenient way to sign members up and fill our first few
  courses in advance giving us some time and money to get things prepared. The space. The physical space at 442 dufferin is a 30 foot square, with clear
  ceilings to 12 feet and peaks at 20 feet. It's small, but our layout
  is efficient and allows several CNC machines, 6 CAD workstations,
  kilns, woodworking tools, storage, and work benches, all with easy
  access while up to10 members work at once. Machines. The heart of a machinePod is of course the machines! We currently
  have one 18""x40"" travel CNC routerin operational, with 4
  more 12""x12"" travel versions due to show up by march. These
  machines are primarily for cutting wood and plastic, but the 12x12
  machines will set up for some different tasks. Carbon fibre laminated
  sheet cutting, and light aluminium and brass milling will be available
  on they are installed. The 18x40 router also does metal, but we are
  currently restricting that to paid service projects, as it's somewhat
  finicky (read: easy to screw up and break something). We also have in our space a 1987 Maho
  MC5HS horizontal machining center with pallet changer, 48 tool
  changer, 8000rpm spindle, 10 micron precision and
  20""x16""x16"" travel. This machine functions well
  mechanically, but requires a new non intel 8088 based controller which
  we will be building as a group project over 2015. In late 2015 we will
  also perform a complete overhaul, hopefully having the machine online
  and in service for early 2016. We haven't decided on the rules for
  this machine yet. It is a complex machine that requires a lot of
  training to run. To compliment our arsenal of CNC gear, we also will also have a range
  of useful machine, such as the SCM minimax c260, a compact panelsaw,
  planer, jointer and shaper in one wheel mounted package. It tucks away
  under a shelf when not in use to free up space. We also have a drill
  press, a small bandsaw (later to be replaced by a larger one). There
  will also be a makerbot 3D printer for use and perpetual modding. Not a machine technically, we have 2 large computer controlled kilns
  in the space. These are primarily meant for glass casting (lead
  crystal), but can be used for some other interesting things, like
  curing a prepreg carbon fibre bicycle frame. Workstations. We have a fleet of quad core 8gb ram workstations - 6 of which will
  be set up as CAD /CAM stations. We will be running Autodesk Fusion 360
  Ultimate on these stations, a powerful package with high end machining
  path generation built on HSMWorks. We chose this software because it
  is cloud based on a monthly subscription, and Autodesk provides a
  number of affordable options - even some free - for our members to use
  at home. The computers will also be equipped with a host of other useful
  software including photoshop (only one license for now), 3DSMAX (one
  floating license), and more. We also expect to get a 3d scanner, although we have not decided
  which one yet. We have access to some of the low cost hand held
  models, but are itching for something more advanced. Other tools. In addition to machinery and computers, we have a host of power and
  hand tools, clamps, workbenches, etc to round out the space. Memberships. The core of any makerspace is it's members. We want to make this
  space accessible to as many people as possible, so we have tried to
  make our memberships carry a lot of value and be very flexible. Oneshot User (this is not available as a perk here,
  message us for more information) Fees. $40 per day. $100 per hour professional assistance with machine running,
          programming and design. All cutting tools, special fixtures and materials extra

  a lot more access and freedom. This will come with special training to
  use the machines unsupervised at any hour. You can gain free membership time by helping with group projects,
  donating tools and materials we need, teaching a course, or being one
  of our interns. For the moment, you must be over 18 to be a member of the machinePod.
  This is for safety reasons. We may change this in the future somehow. Courses. The machinePod is not just a place to come and use some tools, it is
  a place to LEARN! On Saturdays and Sundays, we will be having an ever expanding array
  of single and multi day courses for people to learn how to make
  something cool. The courses will be focused and complete, and of
  course, be based around using CNC machines. Courses that we have already locked down are building a telecaster
  guitar, creating molds for chocolate and candy (SIGN UP FOR THESE TWO
  COURSES NOW!), a multi-week course creating cast lead crystal
  sculptures from an old CRT monitor, and making a carbon fibre bicycle
  saddle. For our courses, you only have to bring yourself, all
  materials are included, and you don't need to be a member to sign up.
  Some member levels entitle you to a discount on our classes. If you can create and teach a course, we offer a number of incentives
  in the from of a fixed fee or free membership time. Long term group projects. We will also be hosting long term projects - things that can't be
  organised into an easy couple of days. An example of this would be
  designing and making a slip cast set of pottery dishes. This takes
  many sessions over several weeks to complete. For these projects we
  offer a materials bundle, and instructions so you can move forward on
  your own time, yet still get help from the group. In addition to the pottery project, we have several of these ideas
  planned, including some carbon and steel bicycle frame building
  projects. Like courses, we offer incentives to people who can devise a
  project for the group. Services. We can provide many CNC related services. CAD design, programming,
  fixture setup, machining, mold making, and woodwork are available for
  reasonable fees starting at $100 per hour with great discounts to members. Partners. Our partners are companies and groups that are teaming up with
  wotzBotz to extend the value of the machinePod even further. Would you
  like to be a partner? Message us and we can discuss it! We are currently partnered with TapLabs in Ajax who are providing us
  with a nice 3d printer and scanner in trade for a cnc milling machine. We have also partnered with Corina Clarin, a local baker, for mini
  cheesecakes to keep us all fed. OK, just me fed. i don't share

200,What Would You Do to Find Your Lost Child?,Canadian Dollar,,of $5k goal,3,4%,"I am here ask for your help to find Arriana Jade the child
    that I was supposed to adopt from the Philippines. I want to find
    her and give her a chance at a good life. The way I plan to do this is in 2 steps: Locate her using investigators in the Philippines, make contact
      with her biological father who has custody of her, and offer to
      help him financially take care of AJ. Rebuild my cleaning business so that I always have money to take
      care of her when she needs me. Medical care is not free like
      Canada and she needs to go to a good school. Right now, I am buying cleaning contracts and marketing from a
  company called the Janitors Edge. So far, they have helped me get a
  good start. I at one time co-owned a commercial cleaning business with
  my ex-wife in Fort McMurray but she is currently running it now. We
  had this business for 5 years before I was forced to leave it. I loved
  my business because it supported me and helped me send money to
  Arriana Jade’s foster parents to take care of her in the Philippines
  while my ex-wife and I were trying to adopt her. However, before I even ask you for one dollar. I should let you know
  more about myself and give you some insight into my character and the
  compassionate love that I have for Arriana Jade my child. This letter is a true story and I am writing it in a way as if I am
  telling it to Arriana Jade in person. I am writing it to give to her
  in the future so she understands who she is to me and what kind of
  person I am. The last time I saw her she was still a baby. It is my
  hope that I can show her that my heart is always with her when I
  cannot be. My darling AJ I know that you probably do not know who I am but from
  across the Pacific Ocean in a country called Canada I love you and
  miss you terribly. You see at one time you were going to be my child I
  was supposed to adopt you and bring you to Canada. It was supposed to
  be my job to give you a good life and raise you to be beautiful and
  strong.You may not remember me because you were only a baby when I
  last saw you, held you and played with you. You are probably wondering
  who I am, so I will tell you all about myself and let you know how it
  came to be that I was to adopt you and why it didn’t happen. My darling I was born in 1980 to a 16-year-old girl who had run away
  from home in the North West Territories to Edmonton Alberta. She had a
  job cleaning a motel where she met my biological father who was a
  welder. This man never knew he had a son.Being so young, my mother
  could not take care of me and gave me up to be adopted. I am glad to
  be alive and thank God everyday that she had me. I did not always feel
  this way AJ, my childhood was hard. Moreover, I did not want things to
  be like that for you. My adoptive father was angry, impatient, physically and verbally
  abusive and this caused me to grow up with post-traumatic stress
  disorder. Many people might have felt I was shy but I always had a
  pure fear in me that I was going to die even in normal situations. I
  also had the fear that I would repeat that same cycle with you my
  baby, I was afraid that maybe I wouldn’t love you as much since you
  are not my biological child and not of my flesh and blood. I was wrong to be afraid when I carried you and kissed you on your
  head I knew that I love you and want you so much that I still think
  about and long for you and your smile every day. Some people may say
  that a child that is adopted should be glad that they were adopted
  into any family at all but I believe that when you adopt a child they
  are your child and that if you treat them right with fairness,
  kindness and love they will feel that toward you. I love children and I feel that I got this from my Grandparents. They
  gave me a lot of love that lives in my heart until this very day. My
  Grandmother who likes to be called Nana (she did not like being called
  Grandma it made her feel old) was the person who always kept our
  family together she always had a kind word for me; Nana always
  encouraged artistic pursuits like drawing and painting. Grandpa loved
  his grandchildren and put up with us playing hair dresser with him and
  styling his hair or sitting on his lap while he drove us to get ice
  cream. I think Grandpa passed his patience on to me this way since he
  always had time to play with us. He was a real kind hearted gentleman.
  I will always miss my Nana as well she passed away when I was meeting
  you in the Philippines. I wish that you had a chance to know them. With my adoptive father, I grew up in an environment that was bad for
  me and hurt me very much. However, there was a light at the end of the
  tunnel when I met the woman who was going to be your adoptive mother.
  I met her at a McDonald’s restaurant in Edmonton where we both worked
  in 1999. I was 19 and she was 18. She made me feel so alive, her
  name is Cristy and she was a raven haired Filipina with almond eyes
  and a triangle face with big cheekbones and a wonderful white smile
  that went from ear to ear. She did not catch my eye at first but I
  guess she liked me because she asked me out. Our relationship went from one simple movie to where I loved her so
  much I wanted to suck out her breath every time we kissed; she was my
  angel who led me out of my childhood of pain. I promised her and myself that I would do everything to give her a
  good life despite my lack of post-secondary education. I guess this is
  why we eventually started a cleaning business together. 5 years later on October 9 2004, I finally placed a wedding ring on
  Cristy’s finger. I was overjoyed I used to say silently to myself
  thank you for my wife she is my life. I wish things could have lasted
  like that forever, being so in love, but it was not to be forever. My
  darling AJ, your adoptive mother and I had many problems and we tried
  to keep it all together. Sometimes when people love each other they
  still carry a hurt inside of them kind of like the bags you take with
  you when you go on a trip to places. However, that did not stop us from both wanting you and loving you.
  In  2010, Cristy received a call from her eldest sister Grace who
  lives in Ilagan Isabela. A lady had given birth to a baby in Ilagan
  Isabela and needed a family to adopt her child. Cristy and I wanted a
  child badly since we could not have one of our own. I named you
  Arriana Jade because I wanted you to have pretty and unique name. I
  always liked Arriana as a name and Jade was the name of a Jackie
  Chan’s niece in a cartoon show. Jade in this cartoon is an adventurous
  girl always getting into trouble and is very smart. I did not get to meet you until December 2011 when I met you at the
  airport with your nanny you cried a lot. I almost felt that you did
  not like me. However, I kept up my spirit because it was only our
  first meeting. Cristy and I stayed there for about 4 months I had to get used to you
  my dear, with the bathing, diaper changes and your feedings, you grew
  on me and I love you so much. When I carried you in my arms, I felt
  the love that a father feels for their child. Not much is made of a
  love that a father has but if you believe in the love, that God as our
  father has for us you will know how easy it is for people to miss it.
  After all many people think that men have to be rough and tough all
  the time but it is not true just a God’s love for us is everlasting so
  is my love for you. When I kissed your tiny head and held you, I made a promise to try to
  give you the best life I could and when I played with you and those
  tiny plastic baby toys, I loved every minute. I cherished our time
  together so much. You are my baby who smiled a toothy grin whenever I
  tossed a balloon in your direction; you even used to make a cute duck
  face without even meaning to. That is just a hallow excuse now, I took our time for granted. I
  cried the last time I saw you on Skype. It would be the first and last
  time. I cried when you called me Daddy, it made my tears flow like a
  river. It was later that night on May 14 2013 that Cristy would ask me
  for a divorce. She knew that you were not going to come to Canada, I
  believe she knew since December 2012 that your biological Dad had
  found you and took you to live with him. I had thought that you went
  to an orphanage and I felt terrible and missed you even more. I wish I could have done something for you at the time my baby but I
  was suffering from the breakup of our marriage. I did not have any
  money or a place to go. I had to start all over again. At one point I
  almost lived on the street I was so broke. Nevertheless, I never
  forgot you, my promise or your smile. I still want you, but you have a great gift given to you darling, the
  gift of knowing your biological family, something that I have never
  had the courage to try to look for. You also have your culture
  something that I badly wanted you to have. I can only hope now to
  secure your future. I know that it is very likely your family could
  use the help that I can provide them to take care of you and give you
  a good education. I want to fulfill the promise I made to you the
  first time I kissed your head my darling, for me this is my mission,
  even though things have changed and I can’t be your father……. my heart
  has not, to me you are my daughter. Questions & Answers You said that you were buying janitorial contracts with this
      money how does this work? A. A Company called the Janitors Edge located in
    Edmonton helps me by doing telemarketing and by sending an excellent
    sales person to close contracts on my behalf. I buy every contract
    for the monthly value, so if a contract pays out $500 dollars a
    month for cleaning I buy that job for $500. I want to make sure that this money is not just used on
      business expenses, I want you to find AJ and help her. How are you
      going to make sure that AJ is found if you are starting a business? A. There is no easy answer here and all I can do is
    ask for your trust and to listen to my simple plan. I am not going
    to spend any of the money usless the Janitors Edge sells me a
    cleaning job, there is no upfront payment. I will not spend the
    money on any outside expenses aside from buying jobs when I am
    presented with them. For myself I will spend my own personal money
    and that of my partner Dwayne Fewer on additional business expenses
    such as supplies and equipment. The first month check that is
    collected will go back into the fund to find AJ and take care of
    her.I have contacts in the Phillippines that I trust that will help
    me find the right person to help me investigate Arriana's
    whereabouts. Once my baby is found Dwayne my partner will take over
    from me and I will go to see her. You said that you have a partner wont some of the money
      go toward him? A. Dwayne Fewer my partner understands that for the
    first month I will work any job bought with the money donated for
    free, during this time he won't take any money either. What we both
    want is growth for the company. Why didn't you talk to AJ when you had the chance over
      Skype? A. I shared a problem that most men have when it
    comes to being a husband and father. I saw myself in the role of
    being a problem solver and I had to take a step back and use my
    brain instead of my heart. My brain told me to focus and get the
    money and to bring AJ to Canada and my heart just wanted me to run
    to the Phillippines and hold AJ. Any time I felt the urge to talk to
    her I felt the strong urge to run to her. I couldn't do both. Didn't AJ's biological father take her? Why do you still
      want to care for her? A. Arriana's biological mother is
    an older woman in her late 40s, her job was to plant rice. It is not
    a very lucrative profession and is a very hard life. AJ's father
    would have to be working on farm to have met her. It is because of
    this I feel an urgent need to make sure that AJ has the help to grow
    up to be the best she can be. I still want to care for AJ because in
    my heart she is my daughter and I want her to have the best life she can. What happens if AJ's biological father doesn't want your
      help? A. All the money donated will be placed into an
    educational fund for AJ so that when she is ready to go to
    University she can. What if you can't find AJ? A. It is unlikely that I won't be able to find AJ
    someone in  Ilagan, Isabela knows who is AJ's father. I just have to
    reach out far enough to find her. But even if that doesn't happen
    right away I won't stop looking until my last breath leaves my body.
    I took responsibility for her in my heart and I cannot break that.
    The people that I love are irreplaceable in my heart. What does your ex wife think of all of this? A. I
    don't know she doesn't talk to me anymore. But in the event that I
    find AJ she will be the first person I will attempt to contact.
    Cristy loves AJ and would want to know how she is doing. When you left your house to your ex you must have known
      that the adoption process would not go forward anymore, why did
      you leave? Didn't you care what would happen to AJ then? A. My ex and I were having difficulties and these problems
    were affecting our nieces and nephews who were living with us at the
    time. I thought it was best to leave so that our fighting would not
    affect them. My ex had already asked for a divorce and our situation
    was very toxic. I cared very much for what would happen to AJ. I
    felt at the time she was safe because my brother and sister in law,
    Bong Soriano and Grace Soriano would still be her guardians as her
    foster parents. I figured that if worst came to worst my ex Cristy
    Castaneda would sell our business and move to the Phillippines and
    adopt AJ. Don't you feel that it is egotistical on your part to go
      about and disrupt a child's life like that? What if she is happy
      how things are for her now with her own family? A. Nothing gives me the right if AJ's biological father says
    that it's better for her not to know me; I won't push the issue and
    destroy any happiness that AJ has. She doesn't need to know me as
    long as I know that she is loved and taken care of. I only hope that
    if this is the case her biological father will keep me updated on
    her life and let me help him. What happens if you don't raise very much money will you
      still try to find AJ and make sure she is taken care of? A. Yes nothing will stop me from doing this. I will still
    build up my business and search for AJ. She was my one thought and
    mission ever since she was born, I wanted to bring her to me and
    love and take care of her. And even though I cannot bring her to be
    with me anymore I will fight for her everyday, because whenever a
    child needs someone to care and fight for them there is Dad for
    that. And that is what I feel I am in spirit AJ's dad  and I will
    always love her.",https://fundrazr.com/0tmzd

  simply outrageous. Just to keep our doors open mid-September we took out two unsecured
  loans with 19% interest and short-term payback.  Needless to say it
  has put us behind. We don't want to end up like the local Taco Bell,

  employees, and have seen the ways it can take a toll on the business. Our name, Higher Ethics, comes from four main goals. The first is
  making sure that all of our employees are respected and feel like part
  of a team. We want all of our staff members to feel confident asking
  questions, and suggesting changes. Second, we plan to always carry a
  variety of products that are eco-friendly and/or contribute to local
  and worldwide social issues. Our third goal is for every customer to
  leave the store with product in hand, a smile on their face, and
  intent to return! Lastly, the art scene is growingly rapidly in
  Wichita, and we want to provide efficient space for local artists to
  display and sell their work. Our Mission: to encourage the belief in equality for all things
  living, to provide a place for culture and art to thrive, and to
  cultivate a frame of mind based on progressive thinking. We plan to have our shop open in the heart of downtown Wichita by the
  summer of 2015, or sooner if possible. With all of the planning and
  organizing under our belt, the last thing we need is help with funding

  something I've loved my whole life. I always had to play with my mom
  and aunts makeup, polishes, and hair stuff :) I knew I was born for
  this! As I grew up, still was always a girly-girl. I remember watching
  my mother put on her makeup and doing her hair and asking questions.
  She was so timeless. Through elementary, Jr High, and High school, I
  always bought makeup, perfume, nail polish, and tons of hair products.
  I remember in highschool cutting and coloring my own hair, as well as
  my friends too. Another reassurance that beauty would always be apart
  of my life. I dropped out of highschool very early to pursue my career
  in the beauty world and here I am! I've always wanted a part time job, but only imagined myself
  doing something beauty related (it's what I know.. lol I dropped out
  of highschool to do this afterall). Inspired bymy beautiful late
  mother, beauty, creation, and people, I've been amazed by how talented
  and passionate I've become over the years. I have had multiple people
  who are clients, friends, family, and even random strangers tell me
  that I should start a beauty blog channel because of how well I do
  hair and makeup on people and myself. So this got me thinking.. I
  think I could really do this and be very successful and helpful to
  people who would be willing to watch and learn. I would love to start
  a channel that encourages women and men of all shapes, colors, sizes,
  and personalities how to do quick and easy hair-do's and make-up
  looks. I would also like to talk about my favorite products, what not
  to buy, what's a must, and how to even go to the drugstore and find
  something that's great for a lower cost. I love educating my clients.
  They're constantly asking what's hot and new with hair and makeup, and
  if I have any tips! Just ask my boyfriend, he probably thinks I'm a
  huge mirror hog and a computer hog lol. I stay up sometimes to even 3
  am, watching countless youtube beauty videos, practicing different
  hair and makeup looks, and obsessing about how much I want to be a
  beauty blog professional. I've been reading up on this youtube beauty
  blog stuff and researched the heck out of what I'd need to be
  successful, get followers, and not waste time. Start up would include: a really nice camera that has HD and
  great sound quality, photography umbrella lights, more makeup to test
  out, vanity lights, vanity, organization supplies, editing softwRe,
  campaign promotions, etc. I have tried to save for this, but due to
  business and personal financial obligations, I don't have the means to
  start this. I tried saving for this a few times, but as we all know
  life happens, so my dream gets pushed further to the side. I felt
  weird and akward calling relatives or close friends. So I am
  announcing to the general public my dream and why I want to do this so
  bad. So you can read why, how, and what's been going on and maybe you
  can help me achieve this.  I would love to show people how passionate
  I am, and how much I appreciate your help through my videos and
  hardwork! Your help wouldn't just get the supplies and equipment I
  need, it would encourage, motivate and support me. I would not let any
  of you down! I want this so bad, I can almost taste it. I would so
  greatly appreciate anyone's help and support through this time! Please
  help donate. Whether it's even a dollar, everything counts! Thanks for
  taking the time to read my hopeful future beauty endeavor :) xoxo",https://fundrazr.com/cwuBa
195,Mama Villars Restaurant Campaign,Pound Sterling,,of £500k goal,12,0%,"My dream is to achieve great leadership ambitions, which will begin
  with the imminent opening of a restaurant; a dream inspired by my
  wonderful and supportive mother. We are hoping to achieve the grand
  opening by the 31st July 2015 to commemorate the birthday of my late
  best friend Jacques Browne. The opening date of the restaurant will
  also coincide with the birthday of a close friend: Matvey Alferov. I already have several eager investors and have identified a
  location/space for the restaurant; it will ideally be situated  in the
  heart of London. The restaurant will hopefully signal the beginning of a broad
  business plan for the Royal Villars Empire. I hope to set up with the
  assistance of talented partners a franchise named Mama Villars. I will
  also consider expanding the franchise nationally and
  eventually globally. I aim to expand further into other business
  industries and bring to life my various ambitious ideas. I finally
  plan to set up a trust fund dedicated to our friend Jacques, the
  'Jacques Browne Trust Fund', to provide scholarships in order to fund
  talented art programmes. A portion of the profits generated by the
  restaurant will be dedicated to the creation and the growth of this
  trust fund. Yet, my ambitions of opening a restaurant and establishing a
  successful business plan are in desperate need of your support. I would like to take this final chance to implore you to take the
  time to donate as much as you can to fund the Mama Villars Restaurant

170,Curvy Women Deserve Great Clothes Too!!!!!,U.S. Dollar,,of $6.5k goal,3,3%,"Life was great until September 6, 1999 my world was turned upside
  down when my father suddenly died of a heart attack. I was a daddy's
  girl and while I was extremely close with my family, they couldn't
  fill the void with the lost of my father. After his passing, I started
  eating for comfort. It seemed to fix my problems because I just ate
  every chance I got and went from size 8 to a 16-18 in six months. I
  didn't see anything wrong with it because I was comfortable,or so I
  thought. Life is great when you're in college and sweatpants are
  respectable attire for class. As time went on,I noticed I would wear
  sweaters in the spring and summer.That was my way of covering up my
  weight gain. Still not realizing I put on that much weight, I put on a
  pair of my size 8 jeans and realized I'd gained weight! I couldn't fit
  my clothes! oh well, I'll get some new ones. Not realizing the stores
  I would frequent no longer carried my size. I was no longer an 8,
  10,12 or even a 14. At that point, I immediately had to face the
  realization that I had to shop at specialty stores or department
  stores that carried plus size clothes which was fine, but society made
  it seem like the kiss of death. Not to mention the fashion market also
  making it look like the kiss of death. I had no where to shop and
  never felt comfortable in the clothes because they were so outdated
  for my age. Mind you when I was my biggest at a size 22 in my 20's
  shopping at the same stores as my 50 year old mother. As time has
  passed, I've felt my mission in life is for women with curves to feel
  sexy in their clothes because I never had that chance. That's why I'm
  starting this campaign to let you know that Curvy Girls rock. Looking
  and feeling good is a state of mind, women don't have to be any
  particular size to feel sexy. Your attitude and style sets you apart
  from everyone. I'm starting an online store for women that embrace and
  love their curves. I'm bringing style back to women and letting them
  know if you can rock it, I'll have it,wear it with pride, and embrace
  your curves. Even though I decided to lose weight ,I don't want women
  to think they need to lose weight or be in a single digit clothing
  size to look and feel sexy. My store will provide clothing in all
  sizes ranging from sizes Large, 1X,2X,3X and 4x, scaves, and clutch
  purses. This is where Go Fund Me plays a really big role in my
  businesses. I've researched and looked high and low for clothing that
  will only enhance a curvy woman's appearance. Seeing that I'm in the
  process of setting up my website and getting clothing samples thats
  where the big expenses lie. I'm reaching out to social media, friends,
  and family to help make my dreams come true. I'm trying to raise is
  $6,500 by the October 21st( that maybe a stretch but I'm very
  passionate about my cause) the money I raise will go strictly towards
  inventory for the bouqtiue. I WAS THINKING IT'S AS EASY AS 650 PEOPLE
  DONATING 10 DOLLARS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. timing is very important at
  this point my FIRST order of samples need to be ordered Monday,
  October 20th. I'm so excited and am planning to have ALL inventory as
  well ash the completed website ready to launch November 1st. My focus
  is for women to always love themselves no matter what. I love fashion
  and seeing people happy. Thank you in advance for supporting my dream
  and helping me put curvy women in the best fashions the world has to
  offer Curvy Girls Rock!!!!!",https://fundrazr.com/bt5ed

100,Let's Save the Dream of a Taxi Driver,U.S. Dollar,,of $6.5k goal,2,2%,"By becoming practically unemployed and having his private car burned
  by accident, taxi driver Felix Arguelles lost the two main ways to
  support his immediate family. But he is about to lose something more
  valuable: his dream. Thank you for considering a donation to this cause and to
    sharing this link with your friends. We appreciate your support! FELIX’S DREAM In 2013, Mr. Arguelles had two jobs, one as a taxi driver working for
  the state-owned agency CUBATAXI and another job, on his days off and
  in the morning on his way to work, operating as private taxi driver
  with his beloved Fiat car (nicknamed Helix). He also had an ambitious
  dream: to create a private taxi agency with 5-10 cars driven by
  experienced elite drivers Documentary made in Cuba about Felix and his dream The first loss In January 2014, Felix almost lost his job with Cubataxi when the car
  he was driving broke down and could not be repaired. He then spent
  about 9 months without work and without earning any money thru his
  official job. But he still had Helix, his private cab. He was able to
  operate as a private taxi driver and make some pocket money. The second loss In June this year, while his car was being worked at a private
  automotive body shop, a terrible accident happened. By negligence, the
  operator forgot to remove the gas tank to work on the car and a fire
  started in the engine area that left it destroyed. Luckily the fire
  was contained and the car practically burned to the ground. The
  insurance company declared it a Total Loss. Felix didn’t give up and started doing his best to try and get at
  least a second hand car. He held several long conversations with ESEN,
  cuban insurance agency trying to negotiate this. A few days ago
  (October 3rd), the verdict was met: the agency would only give him
  9000 Cuban Pesos (~375 CUC /~430 USD), only enough to buy a new windshield. Current Options To support his family, Arguelles has partnered with other drivers to
  offer city tours to foreign visitors because of his knowledge of the
  subject and fluency in several languages. This work is casual, but it
  helps to bring food to his family table. He might not be able to
  continue doing this soon as the mandatory retirement age is 65 and he
  is already 67. Even though he feels relatively strong and doesn’t
  think he is too old yet, he has agreed to undergo medical
  tests/clinical studies as there are suspicions he might be having some
  health issues related to prostrate cancer. He is not afraid as his
  wife herself is a survivor of cancer However, the main goal now for Felix is to repair his car even though
  it might need to be rebuilt. In that way, besides earning enough
  money, he can be back in the race to eventually achieve his private
  taxi agency dream. In his current situation it is practically impossible to achieve
  this. The cost of the repairs to his vehicle are around 7000 USD (~
  6000 CUC) and as of now he has only around $500 USD (which includes
  what the insurance company paid). ABOUT THIS PAGE AND ITS FUNDRAISING GOAL Advised by his son, Felix has agreed to the creation of this page to
  provide aid in the form of donation from family, friends, former
  clients and any other person wishing to contribute to this cause. The goal is to raise $6500. Any amount is appreciated and valued as
  it would bring us a little closer to achieving the target for
  repairing Helix. The hope is that Helix be reborn from the ashes like
  the Phoenix bird. Even without the full amount, but with enough to
  start repairing the car partially, work will commence and the progress
  will be updated on this page. Your help is important.Thanks for helping to save a dream! Contact If you wish to contact Felix, please call him at (+53-7) 764 3038 or

  now , your contribution is doubled by a matching gift! The average income in Nicaragua is $2 to $4 per day. Women and
  children suffer the most. Limited education, abandonment by husbands
  and fathers and lack of opportunity contribute to endemic poverty. Breaking the Poverty Cycle with Micro-Enterprise The Lending Journey exists to break the poverty cycle. The Lending

  faith-based organization), works primarily with women providing
  education, business training, encouragement and loans to help them
  establish and grow small businesses. Since 2003, The Lending Journey has given out hundreds of loans,
  provided numerous training sessions and spent countless hours over
  small meals discussing self-confidence and worth. The satisfaction that these women feel when they open the doors to
  their small business and the feeling of accomplishment when they make
  their final loan payment is wonderful. As loans are repaid, the money
  is recycled to new loan recipients to repeat the cycle. Pedaling Against Poverty On November 9, 2014, a Team will begin cycling 300 miles – uphill –

  Highway.  The team will be led by Vince Vetro, Founder and

  borrowers face every day and their resilience to continue on. Goal The goal of the ride is to raise $100,000 to provide 1,000 loans to
  1,000 more women. My personal goal is to raise $10,000. McDaniel

    positive reasons. 1. We believe in giving back! We have chosen to team up with
    two charities to donate a portion of our earnings back to our
    community. The Donna Foundation breast cancer awareness A.R.C.V.L.S.C. (American Red Cross Life Saving Corps) 2. While giving back to these charities, we have joined forces
    with many local businesses around Jacksonville to support the
    Community Campaign for a Cause. Each are contributing a special
    offer or gift from their establishment. Each donation made to our
    campaign will receive a gift bag at the end of our campaign with
    many items from our local community contributors. We have involved
    these contributors because we believe without their support, as well
    as the community, it's impossible to thrive. 3. Many small businesses open daily throughout the country.
    Many also close their doors daily. We want to be one that can last
    the duration and provide for Jacksonville! For a small business to
    thrive it needs to be comfortable with expenses and debts.
    Crowdfunding will help us open with much less debt and create the
    possibility to make a permanent home in Jacksonville. This will
    enable us to contribute to the community with less risk of failure. We hope you will join us on our mission to be a community
    supporter! It takes everyone coming together to succeed. Our special
    donation perks are listed below for your convenience. *Please view our perks for your contribution and their

  provide meal plan deliveries, healthier fresh baked goods, and a

  item, smoothies, and better hydration choices. Our goal is to provide a convenient, fresh, and healthier alternative
  meal to the lifestyle we live in today. With many fast food places,
  why can’t healthy be fast, convenient, and fresh? With this concept
  being developed, Ready Fresh Foods will redirect our unhealthy habits
  with an alternative, which provides an amazing menu selection, geared
  towards all lifestyle’s to encourage better choices using healthier,
  fresh ingredients. Growing a single business doesn’t help a community

  that they be NEW. There are two ways to donate... 1. You can drop off the NEW socks at Blum!  A basket will be placed
  in the lobby by my back door for those times when I am not in my

245,Help Pops Start Family Dinner Service,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.5k goal,7,16%,"Help me start 'Famtastic', a weekly dinner delivery service for
  working families in the Ypsi/A2 area. Coming from a working family and
  with my previous experience cooking for children. I have an
  understanding at how overwhelming and daunting it is amongst
  everything in the daily day to have dinners ready. The plan is, for a
  reasonable fee to cook Tuesdays and Fridays and deliver late
  afternoon, early evenings on said days. I will send out a
  email/message/update Monday mornings on what the menu options will be.
  You then can call and confirm if and which day(s) you want to order. I
  also can help with prep or cater your next party. Working with food allergies and cooking vegetarian is not an issue
  for me as i have had lots of experience personally and professionally
  with these things. For many years now ive worked every aspect of kitchens and
  restaurants. From dishwashing to management. Those who have worked
  with or for me know i always put 100% in what i do. Just recently I was, without warning terminated from my job. So ive
  decided because people tend to love my cooking, rather than go to work
  everyday, miss my family, miss therapy/doc appointments for Fin while
  i run a kitchen/business for someone else. I should try my hand at
  starting my own business. I am hoping to do this to have the opportunity to work evening and
  during the day, be home to watch my baby grow, be able to adjust my
  schedule to bring my kid to therapies, surgeries and what not with no
  repricussions and to provide  hearty, healthy food options for my community. The donations will initially go to covering living expenses while
  starting up since i have been unemployed the last few months, covering
  food costs, labor, renting a kitchen space a couple times a week to do
  the family food prep, to buy equipment for said prepping and a 'fridge
  and freezer to store the foods in. I believe between my many years of food prepping/cooking experience
  and cooking for families particularly kids, this can be a huge success. Those who donate there will be a multi-tiered reward system depending
  on donation size. Thanks, Jamie 'Pops' VanEffen",https://fundrazr.com/8syl3
800,Let's Launch Turning Point,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,6,5%,"My Story My name is Joanne Chun, the founder of Turning Point. Even from the
  time I was 8 years old, I recognized people who knew how to do
  business well. One of my first encounters was the ice cream truck guy.
  My friend and I made a card for him because he worked hard and really
  loved children. And we got free ice cream to boot! I was always on the lookout for businesses that “have it,""
  meaning they have that thing that draws customers and keeps them
  loyal. I would even tell my friends that I would rather shop at a
  place where they knew how to treat their customers and employees well
  than at a place where prices were cheap, to match their services. I
  loved the idea of businesses cultivating a fun and creative culture,
  and letting that culture spill over onto their customers. The Challenge There is an epidemic sweeping workplaces today where employees are
  feeling like another number: undervalued, overworked, and totally
  unmotivated to be where they are. And for that reason businesses are
  losing employees and customers at a faster rate than they should. Most
  statistics today show that working people would rather be a part of a
  business culture that keeps things fun, interesting, and most of all
  inviting. “Companies are not only competing for customers and revenue,
  they are competing on the basis of how they treat their employees and
  what they represent. If you have a strong culture, people will not
  only want to work for you, but they won’t want to work for anyone else
  so it’s well worth the investment of money and time” (Dan Schawbel,
  May 2014). What I'm Going to Do About It Turning Point exists to bring transformation to workplace culture by
  helping businesses develop their most valuable asset- people. I want
  to help bring out the best in business leaders, and equip them to
  cultivate those around them. Encouragement, good communication, and
  great relationships make for a business where employees care about
  what they do, and where they become more productive. And greater
  productivity makes for greater profitability. Clients will have the choice to hire me on a one time basis where I
  would come in and unlock specific areas in the business and work
  dynamics that are causing disarray in workplace productivity. I help
  clients come up with the strategy to bring needed change, and they get
  to walk it out by putting those things into place, and watching the
  magic unfold as they do so. The other option is to hire me for one to three month training
  sessions that are fun, interactive, and out-of-the-box. I will be
  working with business leaders and their colleagues one hour a week
  training and conducting exercises that revolve around good
  communication skills, team building, overcoming the challenges of
  conflict, discovering and celebrating differences in personality/skill
  strengths and how to integrate these into workplace dynamics. We will
  develop ways to build up not just their internal community but the one
  they are planted in, that is, how to connect with and invest in
  organizations and people in their neighborhood and beyond who are
  doing great things but needing a little boost and how this will bring
  better connection and exposure to potential clients. The sessions will be custom designed and tailored to each business,
  and I will be pinpointing specific strategies that will loosen the
  things that are holding the business down. The techniques used bring
  proven results, and will transform businesses from being bogged down
  to bustling. And it’s a change that will be personal as well as
  sustainable, bringing a positive impact to those who come into contact
  with the business well after the training is complete. What Some People Are Saying “You have blessed us so much with your amazing words and training.  I
  still think about  and continue to draw from all our sessions
  together. If it were not for you and the time it took for you to come
  alongside us to train us up and equip us, we would not be where we are today.” -Joe and Donna Awender of Awender Chiropractic “She is very gifted. She’s been coming alongside us to encourage and
  support us as we handle various challenges of operating a business
  with excellence. We’re very grateful for her being available in this
  special way!” -Tim and Annie Dang of Perfect Smile Dental How the Money Will Be Allocated Most of the expenses that I need for starting Turning Point involve
  licensing, accounting software, office equipment, website, and a
  vehicle so that I can get to my clients! Please join me in this journey to touch the business world with new life!",https://fundrazr.com/4uijb

  over 30 years. Our family has lived in the Niagara Region for
  generations and we feel very strongly about enhancing our growing
  practices in ways that have a positive environmental impact and result
  in more natural foods delivered to market. We intend to do this
  through hi-tunnel systems, an already familiar sight in Europe. The larger environmental goal and the benefit to the community are
  essentially the same. There is a significant reduction in the amount
  of pesticides, fungicides and herbicides used in this system. The
  reduced pressure on the honeybee population is a direct result of not
  spraying pesticides during bloom. The reduced spray residue on the
  crop results in a safer product for the consumer. We use less water
  than traditional systems through drip irrigation. In fact the water
  that is shed off the tunnels can be captured and used for irrigation! Weather patterns continue to become more unsteady and volatile. Our
  winters are getting colder and unexpected frost events are occuring as
  major temperature swings are the new normal. This structure will help
  eliminate the devastating effects of this kind of weather. Fruit size
  and quality is vastly improved because of the covers. We've already started investing, over 55 thousand in fact and are 3
  years-in growing Sweet Cherries but we need your help to take it to
  the next level. Your dollars will ensure the viability of this
  practice through our first crop and in turn allow us to add additional
  tunnel structures next year and provide our community more delicious
  tunnel grown fruit and vegetable options. We want to start a movement
  with area. You might say we have TUNNEL VISION!",https://fundrazr.com/0vsG7

  person with disability.  I have fibromyalgia and am unable to have,
  even a part time job with fixed hours.  I have spent a great deal of
  time investigating my options; on what I am capable of and what would
  give me the best financial independance and security. Because I have always been and always will be an animal person, it
  was logical I would be drawn to the pet sector.  Both cats and dogs
  respond to my voice and touch and have been attracted to me since
  childhood. I have had cats and dogs all my life and have three dogs
  and seven cats at this time.  They have always been my best friends
  and companions; my family.  I have also been a veterinary receptionist
  and assistant for six years and am able to give medications, change
  bandages and give subcutaneous fluids by injection. Cat owners know cats don't do well in a kennel enviroment. Cats
  really prefer and are most comfortable staying in their own home where
  everything is familiar. The stress of the kennel can affect their
  eating, grooming and all around health.  Knowing your darling is at
  home in a secure, safe and fimiliar environment, being well taken care
  of, gives you worry-free peace of mind. Did you know your house insurance could be invalid if you are away
  for more than four days?   Most insurance companies will not honour
  your coverage if you haven't had someone checking your property on a
  regular basis when you're away.  I will turn off and on your lights,

  your garden, bring in your mail, newspapers and flyers and most of
  all, give your cat the attention they crave when you're not there.  I

"1,215",Naturally Blessed's Blossoming Business,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,12,49%,"Naturally Blessed was in the making long before I realized it. I
  started on a quest to learn as much as possible about holistic living,
  including herbalism and nutrition, to heal my own body. I was able to
  utilize this knowledge fully in the world of soap making, which is my
  passion, not only due to the treasured ingredients used, but because
  these pure bars have relieved a variety of skin conditions I was
  having. Later, my infant son would be helped by my products, free of
  synthetic ingredients. I decided to turn my expertise into a business featuring hand
  crafted, artisan soaps, nourishing lotions, herbal balms, and
  aromatherapy products. The online debut of Bedhead Farm products was quite extraordinary.
  The connections made and stories of those helped by our natural
  products is something I will always cherish. In a short amount of time, the business evolved quite rapidly. As the
  products were less about the farm and more about selecting exquisite
  ingredients appropriate for the task at hand, we changed our name and
  added a new shop, Naturally Blessed . Again, Naturally Blessed is in a transitional period. This small
  business, started with less than $200 initial capital, is ready to
  fully bloom. In order to keep up with demand, we're in need of new
  office and lab equipment. Most profit up to this point has been
  reinvested into product development, broadening our audience and
  exotic ingredient availability.",https://fundrazr.com/0vR12
100,At Truistic's Beer Bread Bakery Startup,Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,1,1%,"Al Trusitic's Beer Bread Bakery David Munro is the sole proprietor of Al Truistic's Beer Bread
  Bakery.  Dave has crafted at least eight uniquely delicious breads
  using a number of differnt styled brews.  Along with the breads
  crafted by Dave he has also created some sandwiches that pair nicely
  with certain breads with the intention of pairing the sandwicheswith
  the beer the bread is made from. Dave used the Al Truistic's Beer Bread Bakery as it's name for a
  couple of reasons; Charities are businesses and have to operate as a
  business and bears certain costs. Some Charities are big business
  raising millions of dollars year over year. Other Charities are grass
  roots and don't raise a lot of money. The CRA has restrictions on
  Charities on how they spend their receipted donations with most of
  that money going into the programs and services they provide with a
  very little money being available for administrative, 'business' purposes. Dave became aware of the business of Charities after been
  involved with a grassroots Charity for more than ten years.  Until
  recently Dave was Board Chair of Ontario Parents Advocating for
  Children with Cancer a role he held for ten plus years.  Dave became
  involved with the organization a few years after embarking on his own
  childhood cancer journey with his infant daughter.  Dave's altruistic
  spirit has also seen him through more than one hundred whole blood
  donations to say thank you to others who helped save his daughter's
  lifeby donating their blood. It is the ultimate goal of Al Truistic's Beer Bread Bakery to
  sponsor the Administrative role at OPACC to ensure one hundred percent
  of money raised by OPACC can be used for the programs and services
  they provide to families who hear the words ""Your child has cancer"". In order to get Al Truistic's Beer Bread Bakery off the ground and
  his delicious beer bread into the hands of consumers Dave has found a
  fantastic program through Food Starter in Toronto.  Food Starter's
  goal is to help food start ups get established and grow.  They offer
  four distinctive programsand the Development program will help
  himdeliver his bread to the marketplace and ultimately help OPACC.  To
  do this Dave needs help!",https://fundrazr.com/AlTruisticsBeerBreadBakery
490,"The Earth laughs in flowers, let's keep it smiling",Canadian Dollar,,of $3k goal,8,16%,"A few years ago I started a nursery business in southern BC just
  outside of Nelson called Hedgehog Haven Nursery. Over time I’ve
  discovered the need and demand for fresh seasonal flowers that are
  grown free of pesticides and chemical fertilizers grown in Canada
  using ethical and sustainable farming practices. Did you know that most flowers are grown in South America and Africa?
  Not only is there a massive carbon footprint involved in shipping
  these plants, the valuable resource of water is used to grow these
  crops, depleting this commodity from local food crops. We’re more cognizant of where our food comes from and how it’s grown
  – why not think of your flowers the same way? While the downtime of a farmer is minimal, I’m on my own and the
  bills don’t stop when the flowers do so my winter source of income has
  been selling my artwork at juried shows in Vancouver and Calgary. Sadly, this year after doing both of these shows back to back and
  expending a considerable amount of time, resources and finances, I
  walked away not even being able to cover my expenses, let alone make
  the money I need for the coming growing season. Your support would help me with the funds needed to purchase more
  seeds, starts and tubers as well as get more plowing done in the front
  field where peonies, roses, hydrangeas and blueberries will be
  planted. A small section will be designated to annuals, dahlias and
  other seasonal crops. I believe we can and should be supplying beautiful blossoms right
  here. Ensuring we maintain a healthy and happy ecosystem that still
  includes birds as well as the insects they feed on. It’s difficult to ask for help but I’m thankful this venue is
  available to do so. As I make a minimal income banks won’t give me a
  loan. Thank you for taking the time to read this – not only am I
  grateful for your support but the environment is as well. If we all do small things, it can make a big difference.",https://fundrazr.com/6vFM7

"2,388",Julie wants to take her next BIG STEP!,Euro,,of €2k goal,69,119%,"....En FRANҪAIS plus bas! My path came to me slowly at first . One day I drew a
  little flower on a stray piece of paper. After that I shyly made a
  birthday card for a friend with those same flowers and then I enjoyed
  more and more drawing these little flowers, adding hearts, leaves and
  stars to them. It was pretty and magical. And it calmed my busy mind
    and connected me to a new sensation like something
  was just passing through me, through my fingers and onto the paper; as
  it happens I was discovering Intuitive Drawing *! Mandalas* were next, I loved working inside that
  circle, it felt like an open door to another dimension. And it still
  amazed me I could draw like that, all these forms and colours, I had no idea where it all came from . It felt like
  after having spent so many years not knowing who I was, a new door was
  finally opening inside of me, a door to myself. Wow! I was
    finally in touch with me … ( read more further down) What I want now is to help others be in touch with their own ME,
    and I want to make it my business. To make this happen I want to get the help of
  Business Coach Rachel Archelaus www.sephyrus.com , whose approach is in total
  alignment with my project. Her six months one-on-one Coaching Program
  will help me to launch a business centered on the true me . I am already part of her
  group Business Coaching Program; I can therefore myself vouch for the
  quality of her coaching (details further down ). YOU WANT TO HELP ME? You can contribute with or without claiming a Perk .
  Please do! :) There's some Soul Art , messages, love and more.... I make the drawings just for you
  so you'll feel a connection to yourself when looking at them!! Isn't
  it great! And there is a choice for every pocket! (For Perks you can
  always change the minimum amount shown if you wish). Note : the Perks will be delivered after the 1st of
  April, once the campaign has ended . (All money details further down) THE MAGIC OF DISCOVERING MY PATH The big change came when I started to make drawings
  for others. First for my friend Jasmina, an Art Therapist www.creatief-art-therapie.be/fr , who changed
  everything for me, when, the day I gave her the drawing I had made for
  her, she said ‘’Julie this is a Healing Drawing ! You
  have a gift it’s in you!’’. What?! I could heal with my drawings!!! Suddenly I felt seen and acknowledged and there and then something in
  me clicked. After that more and more of drawings emerged, I made them
  for friends and acquaintances, I gained confidence and it became clear I was on a new path . THE MAGIC OF FINDING MY PURPOSE Helping someone reconnect to who they are is the best feeling ever,
  and that’s how I know it is my purpose. And I want to touch more and
  more people and eventually all types of populations. Being
    able to reach out to orphanages, prisons, refugee’s camps, etc., is a huge part of the big picture for me. I want to guide and help people reconnect to
    their inner self, their inner joy, their inner beauty. THE MAGIC BEHIND MY WORK I have this gift to to translate people’s essence into shapes, colours, so they can see it, recognize it and reconnect
  to it. How? I have extra sensitivity which when creating an Art
  piece for someone, allows me to connect to them by distance, and to
  feel and translate what comes to me in the drawing and manifest their
  Soul in that way, for them. The basis of my work so far has been the making of healing drawings
  for others (individuals, families, new born, etc.). I am now developing a more in depth one-on-one guidance
  method , around the drawing, to help people on their path, by
  revealing, through the interpretation of the drawing, their inner
  power, as well as their main blocks. To help bring about them a new
  sense of positive self-awareness, open new doors to grow and blossom ! WHAT ELSE IS COOKING! Making Murals in places where people are in distress and in need
    of light and hope. Free inspirational videos & articles (blog). Group workshops about tuning in, ‘who am I’? Using colours, body awareness… ‘Inner time’ colouring books with guidance words. ...and the more I grow myself the more I have to offer, there will
    always be something cooking! :) Some magical words about my work: “Julie has this ability to reveal you. Through what she feels she
    puts into light your strengths and fragilities to the point of creating a unique art piece that resembles you in a very
      surprising way , even to the point that your art piece
    becomes like a life companion. In Julie’s Art work I can at once,
    find myself, nourish and revitalize myself. “ Hélène L.G. - Brussels. ‘With a lot of finesse, Julie captures the subtle and
      healing energy in her drawings , a vibration that touches
    straight into the heart, through a beautiful luminosity of colors
    and organic forms … like an offering to life! ‘ Jasmina M. - Brussels WHAT’S THE MONEY FOR To help finance the coaching program, that will help to launch
    my business . Here are some words from the coach, Rachel Archelaus: ‘’..my role in this is to help you grow and become a person who
    expresses herself through a business that creates impact,
      joy, and income .  You will have a launched business by
    the time we’re done, with all of the necessary moving parts (email
    list system, website & copy, offer/product, marketing, systems,
    etc.)..’’. I will get 2 coaching sessions per month, 2 whole retreat days and
  on-going technical support. We will work on thoroughly expanding my
  offer, always making sure it is true to who I am deeply, to my heart
  and soul. I need 2000 € The 6 months program costs $5000 I get a refund of $1000 for the

    I was scared to do this and show the real me , 'what would

    and their own truth , and we are all perfectly
  imperfect! :) To all of you that are helping me today , I am
  honoured by your support. You’ve made your mark in my journey
  and it will stay imprinted in my heart, always. *Intuitive Drawing: a drawing made entirely by following intuition and sensations and
    usually inspired by a specific intention. * Mandala: I found a clear and concise presentation here: http://unh.edu/health-services/ohep/spiritual-wellness/mandalas-spiritual-practice FRANҪAIS Bonjour à tous! Je suis Julie et j’ai un projet à partager avec vous qui est très
  très important pour moi ! Il s’agit d’enfin réaliser un vœu
  gigantesque : être moi-même et partager mes dons avec le
  monde . Curieux ? Ma voie s’est manifestée à moi tout doucement . Un
  jour j’ai dessiné une petite fleur sur un morceau de papier volant.
  Après ça, je fis timidement une carte d’anniversaire pour une amie
  avec ces mêmes fleurs que je trouvais jolies. Je commençai à avoir de
  plus en plus de plaisir à dessiner ces petites fleurs, et y ajoutais
  des cœurs, des feuilles et des étoiles. C’était joli et magique. Ça
  calmait mon esprit très occupé et ça me connectait à une
    nouvelle sensation , comme si quelque chose passait juste à
  travers moi, à travers mes doigts et puis sur le papier; en fait je
  découvrais le dessin intuitif * ! Les Mandalas * vinrent ensuite, j’adorais travailler
  à l’intérieur de ce cercle, c’était comme une porte ouverte sur une
  autre dimension. Et je restais étonée de pouvoir dessiner ainsi,
  toutes ces formes et ces couleurs. Je n’avais aucune idée d’où
    cela pouvait venir . C’était comme si, après tant d'années à
  ne pas savoir qui j'étais, une nouvelle porte s’ouvrait enfin en moi,
  une porte sur moi-même. Waouh ! J’étais enfin en contact avec
  moi … (suite de mon histoire plus bas) Je souhaite à présent aider les autres à être en contact avec leur
    propre Moi. Et je veux en faire mon activité. Pour y arriver je souhaite faire appel à la Business
  Coach Rachel Archelaus www.sephyrus.com , dont l’approche est en
  alignement total avec mon projet. Son programme de coaching privé de
  six mois me permettra de lancer une activité centrée sur qui
    je suis vraiment . Je prends déjà part à son programme de
  coaching en groupe; je peux donc moi-même attester de la qualité de sa
  méthode de coaching (détails plus bas). VOUS VOULEZ M’AIDER ? Vous pouvez contribuer en réclamant ou non une
  contribution . Faites le! :) Il y a des dessins
  d’âme , des messages, de l’ amour et bien
  plus… Je fais les dessins rien que pour vous, ainsi en les regardant
  vous ressentirez une connexion à vous-même! C'est génial non! Et il y
  a du choix pour toutes les bourses! (Dans les contributions vous
  pouvez toujours changer le montant minimum inscrit si vous le souhaitez). Note : Les contreparties seront livrées après le 1er
  avril, une fois la campagne terminée. (détails des sommes plus bas) LA MAGIE DE DECOUVRIR MA VOIE Le grand changement arriva quand je commençais à
  dessiner pour les autres. En premier pour mon amie Jasmina, Art
  thérapeute www.creatief-art-therapie.be/fr ,
  qui changea tout pour moi, quand, le jour où je lui donnais son dessin
  elle me dit : ‘’Julie c’est un dessin de guérison que
  tu as fait là, tu as un don et c’est en toi!’’. Quoi!!! Je pouvais
  guérir avec mes dessins !!! Tout d’un coup je me sentais reconnue et sur le champ quelque chose
  fit tilt en moi. A la suite de ça, de plus en plus de dessins ont
  émergé, je les faisais pour les amis ou les connaissances, je gagnais
  en confiance et il devint évident que j’étais sur une nouvelle voie . LA MAGIE DE TROUVER MON BUT Aider une personne à se reconnecter à elle-même c’est juste le
  meilleur des ressentis, et c’est comme ça que je sais que c’est mon
  but. Et je souhaite toucher de plus en plus de personnes et un jour
  tout type de population. Pouvoir intervenir dans des
    orphelinats, des prisons, des camps de réfugiés , etc. ceci
  a une énorme importance pour moi et ça fait parti de ma vue d'ensemble. Je veux guider et aider les autres à se
    reconnecter à leur lumière, leur joie et à leur beauté intérieure. LA MAGIE DANS MON TRAVAIL J’ai ce don de transposer l'essence d’une personne sur
  papier , par des formes et des couleurs, afin qu’ils puissent
  la voir, la reconnaitre et s’y reconnecter. Comment ? Je suis dotée d’une extrême sensibilité , laquelle,
  lorsque je crée une œuvre d’Art pour quelqu’un, me permet de me
  connecter à eux à distance, et de ressentir et traduire ce qui me
  vient dans le dessin et ainsi de manifester leur âme, pour eux. La base de mon travail est de faire des dessins de guérison pour les
  autres (particuliers, familles, nouveaux nés, etc.). Je développe à
  présent en plus une méthode de guidance individuelle plus
  approfondie , autour du dessin, pour aider une personne sur
  son chemin, en révélant, à travers l’interprétation du dessin, leur
  pouvoir intérieur ainsi que leurs principaux blocages. Aider à amener
  chez eux une conscience de soi renouvelée et positive, ouvrir
    de nouvelles portes, grandir et s’épanouir ! QUOI D’AUTRE SE PREPARE ! Faire des peintures murales dans les lieux abritant les gens en
    détresse en besoin de lumière et d’espoir. Vidéos et articles d’inspiration gratuits (blog). Ateliers en groupe sur la mise au point intérieur, ‘Qui suis-je ?’
    Travail avec la couleur, la conscience du corps… Cahiers de coloriage ‘Moment intérieur’ avec mots pour guider. ….le plus je me développe moi-même, le plus j’ai à offrir, il y
    aura toujours quelque chose qui se prépare ! :) Des mots magiques sur mon travail: « Julie a cette capacité à vous révéler. A travers son ressenti
    elle va mettre en lumière vos forces et vos fragilités au point de
    créer une œuvre unique qui vous ressemble de manière très
    surprenante, agréablement surprenante au point de faire de son œuvre
    un compagnon de vie. Une œuvre que vous vous offrez pour pouvoir à
    la fois vous y retrouver, vous ressourcer ou y trouver de
    l'énergie » Hélène L.G. - Brussels. « Très délicatement Julie capte l'énergie
    guérissante et subtile dans ses dessins, une vibration qui
    touche droit au cœur à travers une belle luminosité de couleurs et
    formes organiques... comme une offrande à la vie! » Jasmina
      M. - Brussels A QUOI VA SERVIR L’ARGENT Pour aider à financer le programme de coaching qui m’aidera à
    lancer mon activité . Voici quelques mots de la coach Rachel Archelaus : « ..mon rôle dans ceci est de vous aider à évoluer et à devenir
    une personne qui s’exprime à travers une activité qui crée un impact, de la joie et des revenus . Vous aurez lancé votre activité avant la fin du programme, avec
    tous les éléments nécessaires (système de liste de diffusion, site
    internet et son contenu, offre et produits, marketing, etc.) ». Je recevrai 2 sessions de coaching par mois, 2 journées entières à
  thématiques ainsi que du support technique en continu. Nous
  travaillerons sur l'élargissement de mon offre, en veillant à ce
  qu'elle soit en profond accord avec qui je suis, avec mon coeur et mon âme. J'ai besoin de 2000 € Le programme de six mois coute $ 5000 J'ai une remise de $1000 du montant du programme

255,One final push,U.S. Dollar,,of $255 goal,6,100%,"My passion is cooking and creating a minimally processed caramel
  popcorn with organic ingredients was a dream come true.  However, I've
  been battling health issues since the Fall.   Thankfully, my doctor
  has found the source of my ills and I'm on my way back to being
  healthy, again.  But during this time, my popcorn business had to take
  a backseat. And that has resulted in my not having the $255 to pay for the State
  license this year. I know that with that license, my business will take off, this year.
    Poppin Robin's caramel popcorn is a one of a kind snack that

  cancer but has remained firmly in the hearts and minds of his family,
  friends and colleagues. Doug passionately believed that business and social responsibility
  were ultimately connected and that by combining profits with a higher
  purpose, a deeper level of success could be achieved. He believed in
  the concept of sustainable prosperity, a vision that views an
  organization’s success as financial progress in step with
  environmental and socially responsible principals. Doug, personally and through his company Frogbox , cared about people and the planet. He
  became widely recognized as a business leader, after being featured on
  the Dragon’s Den, and winning, and has served as an inspiration to the
  business community at large It’s clear that in his short life, Doug hade a tremendous impact on
  business. Perhaps most importantly though, he was known as true and
  trusted friend a devoted and caring father and a loving and committed
  husband. We are deeply grateful for the work and the passion that Doug
  brought to life and are dedicated to continuing his legacy through
  this endowment. The recipient of the money raised here will receive a full
  scholarship to Social Venture Institute at Hollyhock where they will

"7,500",værstasjon for alle kitere på Røssåauren,Norwegian Krone,,of kr8k goal,20,94%,"Endelig er det slutt på bomtur til Røssåauren for å kite, iløpet av
  sommeren 2015 er værstasjon på plass! Røssåauren er en fantastisk spot ikke så langt fra Mo i Rana, men
  langt nok til å bli en frustrende bomtur. Tur/retur Mo i
  Rana/Røssåauren er ca 80km, og om man sparer seg for noen bomturer
  iløpet av sommeren så tjener man fort inn investering man har bidratt
  med til få på plass en værstasjon her. Jeg har sett på ei løsning som brukes mange andre steder i Norge for
  å melde kiteforhold. Værstasjonen driftes av solpanel, og sender data
  til en felles server. Slik at man kan se forholdene på http://holfuy.hu/en/map.php?area=Norway eller
  bygges inn på andre websider med direkte kobling mot denne
  værstasjonen. Eventuelt benytte seg av appen deres for Holfuy Live for
  Android som presenterer værinformasjon direkte. En værstasjon koster 550euro + mva og porto, samt at det vil bli
  belastet noe datatrafikk i tillegg. Slik man bør nok regne med ca
  7500kr ferdig montert og klar til bruk for alle som ønsker å benytte
  seg av informasjon herfra. Se http://holfuy.hu/en/shop.php for
  mere informasjon om værstasjonen. Jeg er helt sikker på at det er mange kitere på Helgeland som har
  glede av en slik værstasjon på Røssåauren og ser fram til å få denne
  på plass til sommersesongen 2015 sparker i gang! Vi sees på vannet!",https://fundrazr.com/eyKx5
420,On a Mission,U.S. Dollar,,of $40k goal,2,1%,"The Short Story: Each of the four strapping young boys in this photo has a goal to
    serve a church mission for two years at his own expense when he
    turns 18 years old. From left to right, they are Michael, Aaron, Seth, and
    Mark...Aaron and Seth are twins, and no, I'm not fibbing. :) These boys have a strong work ethic, excellent manners, and many
    skills and talents that they would like to put to work to help them
    earn the required funds for their missions. They would like to reach out to you through this fundraiser not
    only to request your help with their endeavor, but to earn your donations for their cause. This fundraiser is their way of connecting with you! The Longer Story: Please let me share with you a bit about our family. When my husband
  and I married eight years ago, we blended a crew of seven children
  together. There wasn't a one of the nine of us who had not experienced
  some pretty rough terrain up to that point, and each of us brought
  with us a hope that the new chapter we were opening in our lives would
  be blessed with peace and happiness. Despite the natural challenges of
  blending a family of that size, happiness is exactly what we have
  found, and we give thanks to the Lord every day for bringing us all together. The four young men in the photo are our youngest children. Since I
  had the pleasure of giving birth to each of them, I've also had the
  perspective of seeing what they've been through from the start. With
  beginnings so humble and so tough, I worried how their
  experiences would affect their future possibilities. However, I could
  not be more proud of the young men they have become. They are
  intelligent, hardworking, thoughtful, and well-mannered. They love to
  serve others and to make their lives useful to God. They have chosen
  to be stronger than the things that have happened to them, and it
  makes me smile to know I get to be their mother. :) I am an artist, designer, and schoolteacher. :) Three years ago, I
  developed a severe intolerance to gluten. I got very ill and ended up
  struggling with my health so much I had to stop teaching. It broke my
  heart because not only did I love it, that was my way of helping the
  boys save what I could for their missions. But we were again blessed.
  Fortunately, nothing stands between me and the foods that I love for
  very long, so as I felt well enough, I went to work here at home
  developing recipes and techniques for creating very tasty gluten-free
  dishes. It's a good thing I did, because a year ago, Aaron developed
  the same severe intolerance. He has since taken a genuine interest in
  learning to make good food, especially of the gluten-free variety. His
  brothers cook well also, and all have their specialties, which sure
  makes mama proud. ;) My good husband is a veteran of the United States Army. He served our
  country for 26 years both stateside and overseas. After his retirement
  from the military, it was very difficult for him to find work to
  support our large family. Companies don't always recognize how
  military skills translate to civilian career paths. Although we had
  prepared for an interim of unemployment while he looked for a job, we
  were not prepared for it to last as long as it did, and the money we
  had saved from my teaching position to help the boys with their
  missions had to be used to get us through. The Lord has blessed my
  husband recently with a steady income, and we're doing our best to get
  back on track now as quickly as we can. As for the boys, let me share more about them. Michael, Aaron, and
  Seth all do percussion at their school campuses and are insanely good
  at it. Michael also plays piano by ear beautifully, and composes
  pieces for both orchestra and marching band. Mark is learning the
  French horn this year in his beginner band class, and considering it
  is such a difficult instrument, he is doing very well at it! The four
  of them also sing and have performed together many times over the
  years. They even sang at the ring ceremony for our wedding. They are all comedians in embryo, I must say. Their wit is quick and
  their humor is contagious, which certainly makes our home a more
  enjoyable place to be. They are all excellent with small children, even babies, and have
  experience with babysitting as well as caring for the elderly and the sick. They have worked together at a lawncare business, and do a bang-up
  job of mowing, trimming, edging, and weeding. In addition, they have
  chores here in our home and know how to do the basics very well. They
  are proficient at laundry, dishes, floor care, dusting, cleaning
  bathrooms, and even scrubbing grout. I admit I have trained them well! They are good boys and they want to work. Let them know what they can
  do to earn your donation! Some Options to Consider Order gluten-free handmade artisan pastas Order gluten-free handmade breads, such as pizza crusts, naan,
    tortillas, loaves, biscuits, rolls, muffins, scones Order gluten-free homemade treats, such as cakes, cookies,
    cupcakes, pies Request babysitting Request lawn care Request household chores Donate in response to a posted musical number, photograph, or
    video clip Donate directly to their mission funds Donate to promote their skills and talents Donate because they are just that awesome and you'd like to cast
    your vote for their efforts! Thank you with all of our hearts for supporting their cause. Each
  mission will cost roughly $10,000, and with Seth and Aaron leaving at
  the same time, it is a concern how we will help them afford it. This
  fundraiser will certainly help them achieve this worthy goal. We can't
  express in words what even the smallest contribution means to us!",https://fundrazr.com/dkqxe

"33,514",Rebuild Eden on the River after cyclone Pam,Australian Dollar,,of $69.1k goal,45,49%,"Rebuild community embedded tourism and farm project in Vanuatu
    after cyclone Pam On Friday 13th of March, Vanuatu was hit by cyclone Pam, one of the
  strongest cyclones ever recorded in the southern hemisphere. Much of
  the rural population has lost their homes. The Eden on the
  River property has been severely damaged to the point where the
  rebuilding efforts and the loss of business threaten the survival of
  our project; a project that is deeply rooted within the surrounding
  community and therefore is not only vital to us but also our local
  employees and their families. What is Eden on the river ? Eden on the river consists of two components, located in the
  community of Rentapao, 30 minutes outside of the capital Port Vila.
  Since 2010 the tourism division has developed five different
  ecological and cultural tours (garden, river, bridge, eco and farm
  park tours) and has just won the Westpac Vanuatu Tourism Award of
  Excellence (in the category Cultural/Eco tour) a mere week before
  cyclone Pam. 2014 saw the opening of our Eden Tea House providing
  drinks and lunch items. The second component, Yo Ku Farm , is a small commercial farm
  that currently operates a 35 sow free-range piggery. The aim of this
  operation is to breed a line of pigs that is suitable for the tropical
  environment, using mostly local produce as feed. Yo Ku Farm also works with local farmers in order to improve their small herd
  management skills. Excess stock is sold to Ni-Vanuatu families to
  support the local economy and traditions, as well as improving the
  village herds. Eden on the River operates in a rural environment and we
  deliberately try to employ people who live in the surrounding area.We
  only hire Ni-vanuatu staff and strongly encourage the hiring of family members. We employ eight full time staff, 14 contract tour guides, a contract
  bus driver, a contract builder and often, temporary workers for
  special projects. Training and education are a priority, enabling the
  staff to mature and grow, improving their skills while still
  fulfilling their own family obligations. About 70% of our staff are
  women and 80% have had no previous employment. Several of our staff
  were illiterate before joining our team, part of our core training
  program is ensuring basic literacy. Each of them is encouraged to get
  involved in the part of our business that most interests them. To this
  end several are receiving in-house training in office skills and are
  involved in the daily running of the office, while others have chosen
  to become more involved with the daily running of the café.
  Suggestions for improvements are actively sought and encouraged. Nearly all our female employees are mothers and most of them find it
  impossible to work full time; however, they are able to make a real
  contribution to their family finances by working 1-4 days a week. They
  bring to their tour guide positions a caring attitude that is
  impossible to teach, and their special personalities are seen
  reflected in the many comments on trip advisor and personal comments
  to us from clients. Our success as a new business can be directly
  attributed to these women. Why we need your help? Cyclone Pam severely damaged our office and the cafe, most of the
  animal enclosures in the farm park and the piggery. Fences throughout
  the entire property have been flattened by falling trees. The
  suspension bridges for our bridge tour are luckily mostly intact.
  However, one of them sustained major damage. About 20% of our garden
  and forest, the heart of all our tours, has been destroyed
  permanently; the remaining 80% will hopefully grow back in the next
  6-12 months. Staff housing and the workshop have also suffered major
  damage. Since the cyclone we have had ten additional workers on
  average every day to assist with clearing debris. We are committed to rebuilding Eden on the River because it
  is our life and the livelihood for our 24 permanent staff, the many
  project workers and their families. One of our commitments during our
  40 years in Vanuatu has been improving the livelihood of the community
  we belong to. We are involved in local tourism, commerce and livestock
  organisations which is why we are able to anticipate the need for pig
  donations to small holdings farmers. Vanuatu will experience enormous
  food production pressure in the coming months. Many of the farms and
  gardens have been destroyed and this leaves a huge food deficit the
  government and aid agencies are struggle to fill. The local staple
  diet of root crops is the same as the feed used for pigs. Many pig
  farmers will be forced to sell or eat their pigs, which is the
  standing recommendation of animal welfare organisations as food and
  water security has been threatened. That also means that we will have
  to import pig feed which results in higher feed prices. Donations will
  be used to provide small holders with free pigs to replenish their
  livestock and strengthen genetic diversity once the situation has improved. One of our strong beliefs is in education. The community in Rentapao
  does not have a kindergarten and discussions with staff revealed this
  as a primary need. Donations received in excess of our rebuilding
  needs will go towards building a kindergarten on our property open to
  the children in our community. At the moment we don’t generate any income because we are still
  dealing with the aftermath and there are hardly any tourists in
  Vanuatu. We are hoping to resume business as usual within the next few
  weeks but this depends on us being able to rebuild. This is why we
  need your help! How can you help? We need: You to share our message with as many people as possible 46,500 AUD to rebuild the structures that have been lost: café,
    office, animal shelters, workshop, staff housing for 4 staff with
    their families 15,000 AUD to be able to donate 50 pigs to farmers who have lost
    their livestock due to Pam: 7,600 AUD to build a kindergarten for the children in our community Any money raised over our goal will be used to cover school fees
    for the children of our staff members and their families If you have questions or would like to have additional information
  about Eden on the River you are more than welcome to contact Carolyn
  via email (ernst@vanuatu.com), facebook (Eden on the river) or
  telephone (+678 774 888 0). You can find Eden´s history and the most
  recent development on our Facebook page or website . What Eden on the River means to our staff Collete, Office manager since 2012 Eden helps me a lot with my financial needs like school fees for my
  son and little sister, building a house with my husband and supporting
  my parents. I really like working here because I have learned many
  different things like how to use a computer and accounting program,
  how to run an office, first aid and life saving courses. Florina, tour guide since 2014 This is my first job ever and I have been able to improve my English,
  my French, my office skills and get work experience. I have a little
  son and as a tour guide I have flexible work and still find time to go
  to university and look after my son. Through my job I earn money that
  I can use to pay for bus fares, go to the hospital and pay for my son. Jacklyn, tour guide since 2014 My job at Eden on the River helps me pay for my daughter’s school
  fees, our house, food and kitchen supplies. The job is flexible and
  that gives me time for my daughter and time to look after my garden. I
  like working at Eden because I could improve my English and meet
  different people. Nellie, housekeeper and training for cafe kitchen since 2015 Not all of us went to school for a long time so Eden is the place
  where we learn English and are trained to be an educated person and
  have a real job. Leserei, Cafe staff and tour guide since 2013 This job is important to me because I have a family and I can pay
  school fees for my kids. In Vanuatu, the education standard is not
  very high and the school is expensive. I can also help my family if
  they need something because not all of them have jobs. I like working
  at Eden because I meet new people, I can socialize with other people
  and have fun with my colleagues. More photos from Eden before the cyclone : Our staff in the river",https://fundrazr.com/fxqpb
"1,020",Barry Nettrour's Family Going Forward,U.S. Dollar,,of $30k goal,2,3%,"Though our homestead has been saved with a loan from members of our
  local church, we are facing different difficulties.  Because of that
  the focus of this site has changed to the smooth running, upkeep of
  our homestead while still seeking the funds to pay the loan back to
  our Christian friends soon.  Without Barry it is going to be a
  challenge as he had so much knowledge in his brain and his experience
  was so vast, that there is no one and nothing that can replace him.
   That is not even counting the love he showered on us and his
  unselfish example of a true godly man.  We are trusting God and His
  faithfulness while at a loss of how this all fits into His perfect
  plan.  We don't need to know.  We trust Jesus.  We offer a place here
  for those who want to use this site to help us financially in our
  struggles ahead.  Thank you. Because of a loan from wonderful Christian friends we were able to
  pay off the mortgage on our homestead. If you would like to help us
  pay off our loan to them sooner or help us with our farm expenses,
  comment your preference with your gift. We are praising God for the help He has given us in resolving the
  issue of our homestead.  Our thanks go out to all of those who have
  helped in this and will help in this.  Below is our story.  The
  updates will fill you in on how God resolved this.  I will keep
  updating as long as God gives me something to write here.  It may not
  be as often as it was at the start or it may be.  I just don't know. Our story and updates: A friend asked us to tell our story here, so anyone wanting to help
  had this outlet. Another friend is still working on other fund raisers
  for us and we are so thankful for her efforts. But our time is running
  out to resolve this, so here goes…By the way you can also help by
  sending a check made out to The Rock Mission Center and put Nettrour
  in the memo line or in a cover letter.  The address is: The Rock Mission Center P.O Box 158 Eagle River, WI 54521 08-07-15 Update:  Because of a loan from wonderful Christian friends
  we were able to pay off the mortgage on our homestead. If you would
  like to help us pay off our loan to them sooner or help us with our
  farm expenses, comment your preference with your gift. 7-24-15 Update: Because we had the successful bid to redeem our
  property at the sheriff's sale we know what we still need. Since we
  have been helped outside of the fundraisers through our church, and
  many Christians—members of the one church all Christians belong to—we
  now only need $20,000. But our time is limited to raise this so we
  pray that if you want to help that you do not delay. God will work but
  for any of us to receive the blessings we need to be a part of that
  work. I will be glad when we can be beyond needing this help and can
  start helping others again. It truly is more blessed to give than to
  receive, but right now God is putting us on the receiving end. We have
  really learned that there are many people who actually listen to God's
  voice and do as He bids because we have had many miracles God has used
  His people to perform. Thank you all. Most of you are only known by
  God, but He is the one Who gives the blessings that matter so that is
  good enough for us! We will keep the update for 30,000 though in case we go over what is
  needed.  If we do that will help with the running and expanding of our farm. Many have liked my breakdown of what it would take to raise this
  money, but now it is lost in my updates so I am posting it ahead of
  telling our story.  Here it is: People keep saying it is too impossible for us to raise $30,000 in
  the next two weeks. I know God can do it, but how hard would it be for
  people to be a part of it? Actually it is only a matter of
  numbers. It would change if someone gave different amounts but here is
  a breakdown of one way it could work: All we need is 3 people who
  believe in us enough to give us $10,000 Or 6 people who believe
  in us enough to give us $5,000 Or 12 people who believe in us
  enough to give us $2,500 Or 24 people who believe in us enough to
  give us $1,250 Or 30 people who believe in us enough to give us
  $1000. Or 60 people who believe in us enough to give us
  $500. Or 120 people who believe in us enough to give us
  $250. Or 240 people who believe in us enough to give us
  $125. Or 480 people who believe in us enough to give us
  $62.50. Or 960 people who believe in us enough to give us
  $31.25 Or 1920 people who believe in us enough to give us $15.63
  (which will actually give us an extra $9.60 as it is actually $15.625
  needed for 1920 people but if I drop the .005 it is only 29,990.40 and
  not 30,000) That is if we still only need $30,000 more than we
  have already raised and they have not added too much more from the
  bank and lawyers for legal fees, interest etc. I am still waiting on
  the actual payoff from the bank which should be coming to us any day
  now. But no one has to wait on that! We are the Nettrours. Barry is my husband. I am Nelani and since I am
  the writer, I am writing this. We have five adult children Joshua,
  Jasmine, Samuel, Heather and Autumn. Then there is our farm. Our farm
  is such a blessing. When we threw out names only one stuck, “Fruit of
  the Spirit Farm”. It is from Galatians, “But the fruit of the Spirit
  is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
  gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.”
  Galatians 5:22-23 In 1976 with our four month old son Joshua, we
  joined my family in Eagle River. We bought land from my parents and
  had a home build on it 37 years ago. Our children have grown up in
  this home and our two youngest daughters were even born in this house,
  on purpose. Everywhere across our land I see my husband’s handiwork.
  It is a blessed and amazing homestead filled to overflowing with love
  and God’s miracles. Anniversaries were not spent with vacations but
  another addition to our homestead like the gazebo for our 25th
  anniversary, swings, a pavilion and sun deck and of course our farm.
  Words would not do our farm justice so I am going to post as many
  pictures as I can get up and add to them as I can. We put this
  fundraiser up prayerfully, knowing that God moves in mysterious ways
  and most often He moves through people. No matter what happens we know
  that Jesus will never abandon us and that we will be victorious. Since
  God’s ways are not always our ways, what that victory looks like only
  He knows. I have also finished the 2 volume book set I wrote during
  these struggles, ""Living Naturally in the Northwoods : The Gist
  of It"". You can find it at: http://3mpub.com/nettrour. Purchasing
  these books or the download is another way to help us save our
  homestead and expand our farm. So, what could turn this blessed
  existence into a state of upheaval and peril? As you can see from our
  description our homestead is scheduled to be sold on the courthouse
  steps at a sheriff’s sale on July 16, 2015. But how did this happen to
  us? With the bad economy and health issues we have been fighting
  battle after battle to keep our home/farm. We thought our hardest
  battle was over after getting back on track with the bank from a 2012
  foreclosure. But when the bank put all of our back property taxes onto
  our mortgage—but would not add them to the principle—our monthly
  payment went from about $711 to $2583 a month. It didn't take long for
  the bank to foreclosure. Though we had held and paid a mortgage with
  our bank for over 30 years and had paid well over $200,000 on a
  $99,000 note, this had no impact on the bank's dealings with us when
  we fell on hard times. They had gone from being Eagle River State
  Bank, the local bank we started out with, to M &I Bank a corporate
  bank and then that bank was taken over by the bank we are dealing with
  now, BMO Harris. They told us they would not renegotiate the loan.
  Earlier this year the bank had already taken another piece of our
  property, a piece we thought was free and clear, before the
  foreclosure notice informed us of a banking mistake that we were also
  told was too late to rectify, as it was just our word for it. What
  happened was that we had taken out a second mortgage on our lake and
  17 acre property to build a shop on our homestead land. Then we paid
  off the second mortgage. When we got the release we assumed it was
  again free and clear. But in some copying mistake the property was put
  back onto our original mortgage when it was renewed and no one caught
  it. We just signed where we were told to sign and thought nothing of
  it. We went on making our payments until we ran into hard times. In
  foreclosure court we fought to separate the two pieces of property we
  hadn’t even known were still tied together, and they were released to
  be sold separately. The lake and 17 acre property would be sold first
  and if that did not fetch enough money to satisfy the loan our
  homestead would be sold once that sale was confirmed. So when that
  property went up for sheriff’s sale we were ordered by the court to
  get an appraisal. Though it was the middle of winter and not a good
  time at all to appraise property, we had to get the appraisal done
  then. Our lake property, with a tax appraised value of around $140,000
  was valued at $70,000. That in itself testifies to the state of the
  economy, but I won’t go there. During the foreclosure proceedings our
  mortgage had grown to almost $100,000 with interest, penalties and the
  bank's legal fees. So when they took our 17 acres with 150 ft of lake
  frontage we still owed them approximately $30,000. They are coming
  after our homestead for that additional money. So we seek to pay the
  debt off before the sheriff’s sale. If we raise more money we will
  build up our farm. We could not grow the crops we had planned on
  growing for our animals winter feed as they took our 17 acres where
  our farming land is. We are also praying and fighting to get back that
  land taken from us, but keeping our homestead has top priority.",https://fundrazr.com/f10Xae

  more WOMEN represent an estimated 70% of those living on less than
  $2/day. Cultural and legal inequalities in developing countries create
  obstacles that prevent women from starting and financing new
  businesses.This leaves them more vulnerable to poverty, forced labour
  and violence. Yet, women consistently show inspiring resilience and
  determination to find ways to break free from poverty. Many studies,
  and our own experiences, confirm that women with access to financial
  services can dramatically improve the quality of life for their
  families. In families where women have an income, they have a voice in
  financial decisions, resulting in better nutrition, health and
  education for children. When family needs are met, women are more
  likely to invest in their community. When women have the skills to
  participate in public life, government corruption declines. The gains
  that women achieve by accessing microfinance services are almost 3
  times more likely to be reinvested in their children, providing a
  powerful generational multiplier that accelerates economic growth. By Supporting this ride you will be supporting people to start, run
  and grow small business that will creates jobs for family and

  and fitness industry since 1990. I am extremely passionate about what
  I do. I LOVE to motivatate others. I realize not everyone is naturally
  self-motivated like I am. This fundraiser is to help me develop a
  resourceful website to motivate others into developing a healthy and
  active lifestyle. My new website will work across all devices (iPhone, iPad, etc) and
  offer downloadable and printable programs for a variety of fitness
  activities such as walking, running, cycling, triathlon, core
  training, strenght training, and more.  I will be writing and
  designing my own unique programs to upload. The public will be able to
  access these programs for FREE.  The programs will be searchable by
  three methods - fitness level, duration, and type. Once a number and
  variety of fitness plans are made available, I will expand by
  developing a variety of healthy eating and weight loss programs to download. All funds received will go to local businesses in Lunenburg County to
  help me make this project happen. The Media Farm will help me build
  the new website. A local photogapher will take new and updated photos
  required for the new site. Printer's Corner will be printing my
  promotional material for the new website and my business. All work that I personally undertake for this project is volunteer,
  including all the programs I will be writing. 100% of the funds I
  raise go towards the local businesses I need to help me make this
  project happen. However, I know that my own efforts will help me
  expand my personal coaching services by attacting more people to my website. Why not get a loan? Because I can't. I have already tried. I need
  your help to succeed with this important project. I'm very thankful
  for the crowdfunding option. To thank you for your support, I am providing everyone who donates
  the option to receive a perk. These perks are gift certificates in
  higher amounts than what is donated. The gift certificate can be
  applied to ANY of my services (group fitness, personal coahing,
  workshops, etc.). For example, if you donate $10, you can receive a
  $15 gift certificate. If you donate $100, you can receive a $150 gift
  certificate. It's a win-win situation. These gift certificates can be
  purchased under ""Perks"" and will be delivered once the

200,Inspire people to shop locally in YOUR city,Canadian Dollar,,of $25k goal,4,1%,"Hi there! Nice to meet you! We're Adam Moon (above left) &
    Peter Pyne (above right) and we've built a website that helps all
    kinds of people shop locally, but we want to help more (and employ a
    bunch of great folks while we're at it!) We are raising money to expand the inMynd.com business review website
  to encompass and be active in 500+ cities across Canada. With the success we've found in our hometown of Orillia, Ontario , and 30 nearby cities, we think
  the time is right to bring the website to more people - but we need
  your contributions and enthusiasm to make it happen! We are seeking $25000 to cover new costs associated with this
  expansion. At least 20% of your contribution will be specifically
  dedicated to marketing inMynd.com's ""Shop locally and
  review!"" message in YOUR city . That means, if you're from Red Deer, AB and make a contribution - we
  will run an online marketing campaign targeting Red Deer, AB - all thanks to you! To hit our goal of $25000, we only need 2 people from each of
      our currently listed cities to contribute $25.00! In addition to incremental costs for our servers and equipment, we
  need to train inMynd.com brand ambassadors in cities across Canada.
  Their job will be to encourage local business reviews and bring
  awareness to the site by organizing giveaways, attending community
  events, connecting with post-secondary schools, and interacting with
  businesses in your city. They'll also sell advertising to interested
  businesses in your community, with a goal of quickly becoming self-sustaining. Above: Peter & Adam from inMynd.com collaborate with
  Georgian College to help students shop locally. Read more. Watch this short video tour of inMynd.com to get a better feel for
  the site: Here's Some Common Questions & Answers How does your website actually help the 'Shop Local' movement? inMynd.com is free to use, and every business in your community
      can be reviewed for free - from a unique cafe, to a home-based
      salon, to a fantastic plumbing company. (In fact, we actively
      encourage people to submit reviews by running giveaways!) One great review has the power to compel an unlimited number of
      people to try a local service or visit a local shop. Reviews are
      fun to read, don't cost anyone anything, and can convey a real
      experience... It's kind of like 'word of mouth' - but better! So how do you make money? Because of the vast number of people that visit inMynd.com to
      read reviews, we're a great place for a business to advertise
      their product or service. Find out more. Who really owns inMynd.com? Really, it's just Adam Moon and Peter Pyne! We are not (yet...)
      a massive corporation - just 50/50 partners. When did you launch? We've been accepting reviews from the public since January 2014,
      though the site has been in development since the Summer of 2013. Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about inMynd.com! Even
  if you can't contribute financially, you can help in other exremely
  important ways: Like us on Facebook & Follow us on Twitter Find your
      city and write a review (or two, or ten!) Share our site with your freinds, family and social networking groups! Thanks so much for your time and consideration! Sincerely, Adam Moon & Peter Pyne | inMynd.com Founders",https://fundrazr.com/110cif
230,Port Alberni Smart Device and Computer repairs,Canadian Dollar,,of $5.5k goal,4,4%,"INTRODUCING BLUE BANANA GEEKs The complete Technology solution for your business As seen on. Facebook Pages and Groups (Gerald Jack) AVTIMES Your friends and family facebook walls For the past 9 years we have run everything on a shoestring budget – and over time our
    popularity and reputation has grown beyond our capacity to deliver
    good services. We are ready for expansion and growth – so here we
    are Crowdfunding A few things that Blue Banana Geeks can do. We are Blue Banana Geeks – We started out with
  computers and helping with geek toys purchases. Then we expanded into smart device repairs: Phones and tablets, and
  notebook screen repairs. To date we’ve repaired over 300 phones and 200 tablet – in 3 years. Then we started helping small businesses like ourselves with website
  setup, Facebook marketing and promotions. We keep on growing and the demand for services keep expanding. We’re Expanding And the possibilities are endless. So we did the sensible thing and explored our options and this is
  what we came up with: We were approved for a business loan to increase our stock of smart
  device parts for repairs and also to purchase more specialist tools so
  we can meet the demand of the work coming in for our repair business. We also plan on developing a snazzy website so that we represent our
  business well online and offer marketing and Facebook services to
  clients near and far. We also plan to develop our network of technology specialist so we
  can provide a fully integrated service to our technology clients. We also adopted Minions in the process as they somehow fit our brand
  perfectly – geeks who love bananas – so check out our perks to see
  what we can offer you Minion fans. We Have Some Goals for this campaign First, we are looking for partners interested in working with us to
  provide technology repairs faster and cheaper – Get in touch we want
  to hear from you. Second, we want to find network partners interested in being a part
  of our long-term success story, it’s important to us so drop us a line
  in the ‘Comments’ section of this campaign page we’re looking forward
  to hearing how we can work together. Third, we want to help more people become aware of who we are and
  what we're about. Finally of course we want to raise as much additional investment into
  our business as possible so we can implement our expansion and growth
  quickly and meet our customer needs. Extended Network For Complete Technology Solutions Partner, network, ‘family’ If you haven’t heard the name 'Gerald Jack' yet or worked with Blue
  Banana Geeks, here's why :) We developed our business plan to be word of mouth. We posted a few
  ads here and there and we often received referrals from our current clients. We took on new clients that heard about us by word of mouth and we
  were always kept really busy so we didn’t see the need to do more marketing. We also didn’t want to expand too fast, but eventually our name
  snowballed and our reputation grew to the point where we are now known
  in many different countries. By developing and building our business in this way it has helped us
  to learn lots of lessons and recover quickly from our failures. Over
  these past few years we have become one of the longest standing
  technology service providers in our town and we plan to be around a
  lot longer. We consider our existing partners and network of suppliers as family
  and that has also helped in our growth and now we want to expand out
  some more so we can provide the standard and quality of service
  further afield to our newer customers. So we are inviting you to join our family. The real benefit of course
  with any family business is the family discounts, but also the support
  and encouragement, so get involved. We're excited to make this move into a new direction, and most of all
  with everyone of you. We will post updates often to keep you informed
  on your personal geek services, as well as updates on special deals
  and prices you will only find on this page. Much love from the Blue Banana Geeks team Meet the team. Experienced professionals. Gerald Jack - Trusted Geek Advisor Where we are now. Your support makes our business development a reality.",https://fundrazr.com/f11RP9

"1,670",A way to give back,Canadian Dollar,,of $3k goal,13,56%,"My name is Marloes and last year was quite the turbulent year for me.
  After moving from Golden BC Canada, to the Netherlands and Canmore AB
  in the least two years I was finally ready to settle in Golden again.
  In the midst of the move, I was in a head-on collision on highway 1.
  Luckily I only had broken bones and bones heal. After two weeks
  hospital, three months wheelchair I’m back on my feet, biking and
  climbing again, in less than a year. Without all the help I received
  from my countless ‘Golden’ friends I couldn’t have done this, living
  miles away from my family. Many people told me this was going to be a life changing experience
  and first I didn’t understand what they meant. I was focused on
  healing and getting back to my ‘normal’ life. Now almost a year after
  I look back and it was indeed a life-changing event. One lesson I’ve
  learned is how it can change someone’s life when you give. All the
  love, help and support I’ve received when I was helpless, was
  incredible. The countless visits, people who drove me around, did my
  groceries, made me food, brighten up the days and helped me stay positive. So when my friends Lisa & Roland told me about Opportunity
  International and their fundraising event this summer, I didn’t have
  to think twice. Training for an 80km bike ride and fundraising money
  for entrepreneurs in parts of the world that aren’t as fortunate as we
  are, seemed the perfect match for me. Opportunity International raises money to provide financial solutions
  so people living in poverty can grow their business to provide
  themselves, their families and communities with a better future. If
  you want to know more about this organization, please check out this
  website: www.opportunityinternational.ca Our bike team set a goal to raise $ 3000 per member, so I’m asking

  poorest country in Latin America and the second poorest in the Western
  Hemisphere after Haiti. Close to 50% of the 6.5 million people are
  living below the poverty line (32% with less than $2 per day). The
  unemployment rate is 7% and underemployment is over 46% which means
  that most Nicaraguans do not have a source of income to meet the most
  basic needs of their families. Nicaragua needs an influx of capital to
  stimulate the development of the private sector in the poorest and
  marginalized areas of the country in order to break the cycle of poverty. OPPORTUNITY INTERNATIONAL Opportunity International provides access to financial solutions
  empowering people living in poverty to transform their lives, their
  childrens futures, and their communities. $150 dollars funds one loan,
  is repaid and re-loand every 3 months and helps mothers provide more
  meals, regular schooling, and basic santization for their kids.
  Families, communities, and regions are developing out of poverty
  because of this powerful tool that is recycled and multiplies. Read
  more WOMEN represent an estimated 70% of those living on less than
  $2/day. Cultural and legal inequalities in developing countries create
  obstacles that prevent women from starting and financing new
  businesses.This leaves them more vulnerable to poverty, forced labour
  and violence. Yet, women consistently show inspiring resilience and
  determination to find ways to break free from poverty. Many studies,
  and our own experiences, confirm that women with access to financial
  services can dramatically improve the quality of life for their
  families. In families where women have an income, they have a voice in
  financial decisions, resulting in better nutrition, health and
  education for children. When family needs are met, women are more
  likely to invest in their community. When women have the skills to
  participate in public life, government corruption declines. The gains
  that women achieve by accessing microfinance services are almost 3
  times more likely to be reinvested in their children, providing a
  powerful generational multiplier that accelerates economic growth. By Supporting this ride you will be supporting people to start, run
  and grow small business that will creates jobs for family and
  communities memebers so that our neighbors in the developing world can
  have dignity and purpose through personal achievment. The tool of

200,Support Burnout King's development,,,,,,"Burnout King , brought to you by two mobile gaming
  enthusiast and supported by one of the top burnout teams in Australia
  aims to bring the intense petrol fuelled world of burnouts to your
  mobile devices. Progress so far: So far we have produce a lite proof of concept that aimed to prove a
  few keys components: First off that we can produce a burnout game that performs
    smoothly on a mobile device whilst holding true to the core burnout mechanics That we can refine the control inputs and create a control
    scheme for burnout gameplay that is both fun and also challenging
    aligned to the challenges of actually controlling a burnout in real life That we can build an interactive map to allow the player a
    ‘sandbox’ environment to explore and discover events / interact with
    the game That this game will be challenging, rewarding and fun! Now that we have proved the 4 key factors listed above it is
      time to move into developing the full-blown first version of
      Burnout King. Our Goal: Our goal is to create the best mobile burnout game possible. To do
  this we need your support to bring Burnout King to your phone/tablet
  and to make sure that it is the best possible game that we could develop. The key features that we need to build to make it an awesome game: Burnout Gameplay! This may sound like a
    no-brainer however it isn’t as easy as it sounds! As there are
    currently no pure burnout games on the market we are developing the
    gameplay to mimic the real world experience of doing a burnout.
    Supported and play-tested by our friends at H8tred racing we are
    tweaking our game engine to bring you the balance between realism
    and fun! Customisable cars: The world of
    competition burnouts is based around a culture of uniqueness and
    auto modification. We need to carry that through into this app and
    ensure that the customization abilities for the cars that you choose
    to build are in-depth, meaningful and of course as crazy as they are
    in real life. Tweaking, tweaking and more tweaking: Once
    you have customised your car you can be the mechanic. Just like in
    the world of competition burnouts your car is your temple and you
    can tune it exactly how you would like. We want to bring this
    experience through into the game and allow you to specifically tune
    your vehicle of choice for each event. A clean UI. It sounds simple however
    designing and building a clean, usable and intuitive user interface
    is an art in itself. Game modes – whether you are starting off
    in your burnout career or taking one of the bespoke – real world
    legends cars for a spin we need to build in all the fun and
    sometimes painstaking parts of the burnout lifestyle into Burnout King. Timeframes: We have developed an initial gameplay demo that turned out
    pretty cool! We are aiming to be ready for launch onto the Apple app
    store and Google Play store before Christmas We will provide updates as we go with early access provided
    to selected community members.",https://fundrazr.com/311xyd

  received my invitation to be a part of Google's Glass developer

  $1500 entrance fee to join the program and start developing for the platform. I have a 7 day window to raise $1500 after which point my purchase
  code will expire. I am asking for your help to contribute any amount
  you can to invest into my future as an interaction designer for the platform. Fundrazr is charging me 5% for each transaction and Paypal takes its
  own cut as well. I will be paying the difference once/if the campaign
  reaches a place closer to the $1400 to $1500 range. I have added three perks at the $10, $100 and $300 level for those
  interested in my design consulting assistance or advisory services. I
  have had the privilege of being responsible for some of the most
  widely embraced (and loved) app experiences on the planet and would be
  thrilled to be able to share my wisdom with others who are just
  getting their product off the ground. Upon receiving Glass I will upload an unboxing video to my twitter

240,Single Mom Touching Lives,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.5k goal,7,16%,"""I want to spend the rest of my life loving my daughter and
      inspiring others. That is what I was created to do.""
    — Marlene Dillon If I see a sad cashier, I'm in her line trying to encourage her. If I
  see a little girl with curly hair, I have to stop and give her a book.
  Empowering others is not just what I do, it's who I am. I wrote I'm
  Proud to Be Natural Me! to give children an opportunity to learn that
  they are beautiful as is. Many parents don't think to teach their
  children to be confident in themselves. It doesn't happen
  automatically. My book is an amazing tool for starting that conversation. I am very proud of the work I've done with little to no money, and I
  know I could have a much greater impact, if I had the resources. I
  wrote, illustrated and self-published I'm Proud to Be Natural Me! with
  no money in my pocket and my little girl sleeping across my lap. I am
  recently separated, sleeping in my parents' basement, but the message
  is so necessary, and there's no more time to waste—children need to
  know who they are and parents need to know how what we say and do
  impacts their self-worth. My book has provided me an awesome platform
  to hold workshops at public libraries, speak in schools and meet the
  most amazing people at networking events. Thanks to my current job as
  a teacher's assistant, I have been able to purchase books, 25 or so at
  a time, to present at fairs and various events. Although, the lack of
  funds has caused me to turn down numerous opportunities to share my
  message, I continue to share, network, and speak where I can. I believe in my book. For all the children who require their parents
  to read I'm Proud to Be Natural Me! to them every night, for the little 4th grade girl I spoke to in a classroom who
  said, ""I use to believe I was ugly, but now I know I'm
  beautiful,"" for the child who's likely never seen someone who
  looks like her on the cover of one of her book, and for the countless
  times parents have come up to me at events thanking me for writing it,
  I know it is necessary. I know it is a message that needs to be
  shared. And I know I cannot do it by myself. As I sit here with tear-filled eyes desiring so desperately for the
  resources to reach more children, to visit other states,speak and hold
  workshops, and even to continue to give books to those who can't
  afford it, I ask how you will you help me accomplish my dream? You can
  share, you can give, you can ask others who know have the resources to
  read this for themselves. However you can help, I ask you to because
  this is bigger than me. This bigger than a single mom who wants to
  give her daughter her own room and a puppy. This is about the lives I
  was created to affect for positive change. Will you please give a
  small (or large) donation and tell others of the work I'm doing? Thank you for your time and thank you in advance for your support. With much love and inspiration, Marlene",https://fundrazr.com/2MCJ3

I have been utilizing every possible resource I can to get this dream started, and I am now open for business. The place looks great! I have done most of the work and paid for as much as possible out of my own pocket. Since my own pockets are not very deep, at the very beginning of this venture I had to accept a personal loan that was generously offered to me by a colleague in the hair industry. As I'm sure you all can guess, and many of you may know from personal experience, it is always hard to start a new business. Luckily for me, I have had awesome support so far from many friends and family members. We have been able to build one of the coolest salons in town with all recycled materials. But having too little money has always been a problem. I am currently in a situation where I don't have enough cash to recapitalize into my business for the future and help get the word out to potential customers. To make the situation harder, my colleague who I took the loan from is now pressuring me to pay it back early in advance! If I could ask all of you for a little help, it would be most appreciated because this is when I really need it. Please join me and help to make this a stronger business, and with that support I will work to make Nine Blue Salon not only a successful business within the community, but a business that gives back to the community and helps others succeed in their dreams. I consider myself very lucky to be an entrepreneur, despite the risk involved when you start building on a dream, putting in all you have to make something work with very little to begin with. I believe you only live once, and you can't spend your life doing something you hate when you can make something for yourself by doing something you love. I see myself working towards success now, and being much more successful in the future. When the time comes that my salon is established enough, I plan to create and fund a yearly scholarship that will go to help support a student's cosmetology schooling. I want to do this to help pay forward what many good people have done for me. Also, I believe in our Bellingham music scene, all the way down to the little bones in my heart. And I love to help out our local artists.  I have a plan to create an annual concert series sponsored every year by local business… including Nine Blue Salon of course! I believe hair stylists and musicians are a lot alike. And I believe in helping all artists out when I can. Those of you who know me understand that I rarely ask for anything, and that I help others when I can. I am a man that follows through with what he says he is going to do. To anyone that helps me, I hope you understand the gratitude I will feel.  What I’m asking for is this; please come see me for a cut, color, and any other service. Or tell you family and friends to come see me. Every customer I get at the salon goes a long way for me, and I guarantee you’ll enjoy coming in and seeing what I’ve done with the place. You’ll also like what I can do with your hair! If you don’t need a hair service, and would like to support me in my adventure, I have another option.  I have just set up a simple online donation account, where you can give a donation in any amount large or small. Even just one dollar! If you donate to Nine Blue Salon, you know exactly where it is going: To a man with a great family and a big dream. I will do my best to reward anyone who donates to me. I will give many great deals from the Salon, so you are welcomed and encouraged to send me an email when you donate.  That way, as thanks for your support, I can send you a gift card, or even some free swag and product. Thank you all so much for your support… past, present or future! Love, Barrett Lizza.",https://fundrazr.com/1HIu5

400,ZAVATARIS. Express Yourself in a Whole New Reality,U.S. Dollar,,of $50k goal,1,1%,"The whole Theme Concept of Zavataris is it is another Reality created by a species called the Ancient Ones, who were an Ultra Advance Civilization that had the means to ""Create"" a stable universe in order to survive the extension of their own. With them they brought many sentient and non-sentient forms of life in order to preserve them. Despite their ""value for all forms of life"" from among their own kind a branch formed called the Forbidden Ones. In time this lead to the destruction of the Ancients and left the Forbidden locked away in another prison reality. Though this basic introduction to the ""Theme"" seems like the age old ""Battle of Good Vrs. Evil"" nothing is so black and white in Zavataris. This story is also used as a back drop for some of the features in Zavataris, such as weird forms of writing of which there is a full set of the letters, numbers and symbols, artifiacts of ancient technology and ""forbidden relics"" that scatter about many of the regions. THREE MODES OF ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTION In game play mode many of these things will be ""explained"" as the story progresses in different directions with different NPCs. But as said ""it’s not all game"" either. In Zavataris you can ""Switch modes from Game Play"" and go into the ""Virtual Social Environment"" otherwise called ""Social Mode."" In this setting you can interact with other users, build relationships and do all the fun, or boring things you want as in any other said 3D social environments, though naturally some restrictions apply. Finally there is the Third Option. Sometimes you’re not in the mood to socialize, or play games. Sometimes you just want freedom to ""Create and Build.""  This is an option where you can as a developer or designer make your own ""homes, hangouts, clubs, and multi-member participation communities"" as a Governor of up to your own City and allow others to own parcels of land to ""develop"" with you in it in which your own home, hangouts and clubs can be added to, along with shops and much more. How Detailed will the Avatars Be? The simple reality is as shown by models such as those in programs as DAZ 3D should be the target level of end user avatars. Too many sites have in social and MMORPG projects childish, toon like characters and that is not the direction we will be heading. Contributors can utilize Daz 3D models for end user avatars or they can provide their own heavily worked on custom ones if they elect to do so. It is however the quality that Zavataris seeks to implement in this project. Game Engine It is recommended that contributors know how to use and code within Unity Game Engine. It is true that Unity has made some changes to their EULA, however, those changes are not such that would hold a conflict within the development of Zavataris. Along with the DAZ 3D models as examples, this game engine is still one of the best ones available and still a preferred choice for Zavataris. Building your Own Environments and a Back It Up Feature Now take this into “how much time” you spent in those places building them up, refining your avatar and getting things “just about right” where you feel you at least break even having it just so. All of a sudden it’s gone, irretrievable, or some jerk came along and destroyed a true masterpiece. There is no price tag you can put on that and its heart breaking. Not to mention if the place was created with a truly close friend who has “passed away.” It may be a virtual environment but the sentimental value it holds is “heart breaking and real life emotionally devastating.” What if we could in fact (and from a programming end can be done) your able to “preserve it” in it’s entirely in a “Backup” form? It’s still the original creation and has been saved! It is also a feature Zavataris wants in place for you. Now you would think that this goes without say for most ""games and virtual or simulated environments."" Well it goes without say that is actually not the case. The Virtual Memorial Zone project on Zavataris Virtual Memorial Zone presented right in the ""Commons"" where everyone will start in the game world and can have an Open Teleporter that takes you to this location. This is not simply to ""Bury"" a ""virtual character someone has abandoned to make a new one later. The inspiration behind this comes from a heart felt and recognized need for this location and inspired by recent event from Nov 2012-January 2013. Three women who were well loved both as online friends and real world friends passed as a result of cancer and one from a falling incident in her home. They were well known in not one, but several ""Sims/Virtual"" worlds and close friends of myself and were members of this project initially. In memory of such people whose spirit and all over humanity were able to touch the lives of hundred if not more people simply by a few kind words and a true sense of empathy for the person behind the character deserve to be remembered. I cannot adequately express how much it also means to the families and relatives of those folks to have seen so many turn outs of creations of small regions in which their real life names, pictures and avatar names are represented. It will be one of the first few of locations that will be produced and their names will be nominated as to whom it will be named after and will be maintained as a dedicated location throughout the life of Zavataris. Its more than just a game; its a huge family! We recognize both the value these world and environment can have from an entertainment perspective, and we also realize the value of the people who are and were members of our online communities of friends and family and the real relationships they can foster that transcend all border and nations.",https://fundrazr.com/7Kmbe

500,Re-Ignite Play in the World...,Canadian Dollar,,of $3.5k goal,12,14%,"Help fund actor/educator Trilby Jeeves to train with a master in Chicago. A little over a week ago she expressed an interest in enhancing her performance training by learning from Philippe Gaulier (one of the last significant bouffon masters). By fate or coincidence three days later, Fixt Point Theatre called to personally invite her to their “2 week Bouffon Master Workshop with Philippe Gaulier” in Chicago. With the momentum of her own ""Buffoonery Workshops"" (http://www.buffooneryworkshops.com) expanding, the timing was perfect to participate in a two week session with Monsieur Philippe Gaulier was clear (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RI2h55ue-g&feature=player_embedded). And as one of her students who understands the depth of her work, this opportunity will only strengthen her teachings. Trilby says, ""this will take me out of my own comfort zone""- something she encourages her students to do. Here, beyond the “safe zone” we find our gems for life.Flash backward: Trilby was introduced to “Le Bouffon” during her three years studying acting at Le Conservatoire d’Art Dramatique in Quebec City through her teacher/mentor Marc Doré, who studied with Jacques LeCoq (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lecoq), the creator of le bouffon. Le bouffon is a personage who loves to mock and laugh at society - hence, ourselves. This character became an amazing tool that served all her other performances.Years later, after a back operation and months of physio, Trilby found herself unable to continue her part-time job as a set costumer for film and TV. She returned to le bouffon and designed a workshop that has served, so far, over 700 students in various contexts.  Le bouffon also helped her to accept her new physical limitations. Not surprisingly, the buffoonery workshop enables both actors (http://buffooneryworkshops.com/buffoonery-for-actors/) and non-actors (http://buffooneryworkshops.com/priority-to-play/) to embrace their own imperfections, gain confidence and play. It is Trilby's mission to help people truly be themselves by discovering their ""inner bouffon"".By spreading the word and donating, you are sending Trilby to augment her training and also to provide an opportunity to local people, non profits, and businesses who would not otherwise have the chance to participate in a Buffoonery Workshop. More on this story: http://buffooneryworkshops.com/buffoonery-workshops-and-philippe-gaulier/And a Buffoonery Flash Mob bringing joy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EcLeB6JNk",https://fundrazr.com/cLeB4

Why I need funding: $2000 may or may not be a lot to some but to me it would be nearly impossible to raise on my own.  I work full time and a member of the Canadian Forces which provides enough to put a roof over our heads and food on the table for my family but not a lot left over to put towards launching a business. About me: All my life I have had the dream of being self employed.  I've owned and operated many little niche businesses online over the years.  These businesses, even though never brought in much income, have given me a sense of great pride.  I love the feeling of knowing that these businesses are a result of my hard work and determination.  I have one philosophy when I start a new venture and that is to provide freedom for myself while providing value to others. I feel to be truly successful in business your product or service has to not only make money but provide value to others.  I would never want to own a business that's sole purpose is profit at the expense of their customers.  I see too many businesses in the world that focus on the dollar and fail to see what truly is important and that's providing value to others. I've always had the entrepreneurial spirit ever since I was young.  As a kid I remember selling lemonade and fish to tourist visiting our small town.  I remember how happy those tourist were seeing me as a young kid with a bag of fresh fish for sale.  I was happy providing the fish and they were happy to buy them. Unfortunately things over the years have not turned out exactly as I have hoped.  I took a tech support job for a company who doesn't treat their employees very well.  I've been with the same company for over 12 years and receive no respect.  It was their actions this Christmas was the last straw for me.  I have two young children and Christmas day means a lot in my family.  I saved vacation all year long to have a few days off during Christmas.  The company announced that they were approving Christmas vacation based on performance and even though my performance puts me close to the top I was still denied.  I don't want to go into the boring details but needless to say how they handled it was completely unfair. I decided right there and then that my family is my top priority and I'm done with companies who are more concerned over ""business needs"" over their customers, employees and their families. Why I'm here: This brings me to why I'm here.  I've been eyeing a product that retails for approx $1000 that I would like to purchase and setup a table/kiosk within our local shopping mall.  This product is a specialized multifunction printer that can print images, designs, and text on items such as fingernails, flowers, cell phone cases, etc.  There is no other service like this offered here. My target audience are female between 15-30 which is why the local mall is an ideal location.  I've already been in contact with the mall to lease space.   I believe I will do well with this venture and looking forward to launching this business and growing it. Except for the equipment I'm all ready to start this venture. I have a registered business, accounting software, credit card processor, business bank account, payroll account, etc.  I know my price point, cost of goods, fixed expenses, etc. My Goals: I plan to start small and use revenues earned to grow the business.  This is why I'm only asking for $2000.  I know that more funds will be needed and that's why I'm prepared to invest most of the revenues back into the business. I'm asking for your help in raising the money so I can buy this product and get started on the path to freedom from working for someone else.  With your help I am hopeful that my dream to be self employed will become a reality. I don't have a lot to offer in exchange for your donation, however I can provide a free copy of my book.  I'm the author of a downloadable ebook called Mastering Dropbox.  This book currently sells for $25.  For any donation amount given I will provide a free copy of my book.  Just send me an email to masteringdropbox@newrockmarketing.com after you donate and I'll send you a copy as thanks. Also, I'm a huge fan of Kiva.  I've been providing loans on Kiva for a few years and will continue to do so for many years to come.  If you haven't heard of Kiva they are an organization that allows an individual or group to give loans to entrepreneurs to help them start or grow their businesses. Infact a percentage of all profits I currently earn online are invested in providing loans to other entrepreneurs on Kiva.   I will be doing the same for this venture as well.  A percentage of net profits earned from this venture will also be used to provide more loans on Kiva.",https://fundrazr.com/8PRl7

With Kickstarter if You Do not Get the Full amount before the end of a set period of time you do not receive any funds. There was about 881$ Raised, But the Funds Pledged Went Back to the Donors. This is the Recovery Link! We asked for 10,000 for the Kickstarter. We set the Bar because we wanted to show everyone what it takes to even scrape the surface in the music industry. If The 2k Goal is met There will be a High Quality TV Ready Video Created! MISSION The RETRIBUTION Street Campaign is the Newest Project from Artist Alias John Brown (AJB Facebook). Featuring a wide array of artistry and a broad spectrum of production By the likes of Dug Infinite, Keon Bryce, Que Billah, Mikki Boyd, Akil and Many More. It is out now and has been released Digitally on iTunes and several other premium retailers. Unfortunately Some Independent Artists reach a Glass Ceiling. With Limited funds and even more limited resources We are now raising funds to mass produce CD's, T-Shirts, Hoodies and other Promotional Materials. To properly promote the Project we need Revenue in order to secure Public Relations expanding and engaging the growing fan base. A portion of the expenditures will go to the production and editing of 2 quality music videos with intentions to be aired on MTV, BET and other major video based contemporaries. PLOTTING The Plan is to promote to the fan base which consists of over 800,000 through Facebook, Twitter, Reverbnation, Myspace, Youtube and any and every Hip-Hop event tangibly reachable. Building the connection to the urban and suburban communities simultaneously is a difficult task but it is possible if all of the Marketing and Promotional Materials are available. AJB branches out to many unique audiences and demographics not usually accessible to the average artist.This Campaign could really have major potential if executed correctly. With a True Kick Start the Possibilities definitely are infinite! PAPARAZZI A Professional photo shoot will take place. 2,500 Mass Produced, Replicated, Digi Packed, Bar Coded, Retail Ready CD's will be Manufactured. 10,000 fliers, and 4,000 Posters. The Album will be submitted for upgraded distribution Making the release available to 99.9% of the buying public by selling on iTunes, Google, Amazon, Spotify and up to 45 other streaming, download and subscription sites and all major and regional mobile networks. As well as affording P.R from a world class firm that will Manage placement, branding and evolve relationships with Major magazines, Blogs, Radio and other important outlets. OPTICAL DOCTRINE The Videos will Be Top Quality, TV ready Visuals that will display the Meaning feel, and Emotion of the songs. AJB Has Previously Made Videos on his own. They are good, We Need Tremendous! It is time for a Upgrade to take it to the next level. Here's the Promo Commercial for RETRIBUTION SC and a Couple of AJB's Latest Videos so far. RETRIBUTION STREET CAMPAIGN AD http://youtu.be/1L09npWYD_s AJB- WHADOWN http://youtu.be/1L09npWYD_s AJB- THE FUTURE http://youtu.be/wUtmkP-slEA EXPENDITURE REVIEW This Project will definitely cost more closer to the Maximum amount. Less Than Minimum is requested. There are millions of people who wish to live their Dream. Some of the most talented individuals never get the chance due to lack of funding. AJB is a reflection of the people, a portrait of the struggle. Showing the world that with hard work and dedication anything you can imagine is possible. Today is the day to change the life of the artist. This is how the Kick Start will be divided. Photo Shoot= 500 $ Upgraded Distribution= 500 $ Public Relations= 5000$ + 2,500 Retail Ready CD's= 2,500$ + 10,000 Fliers= 400 4,000 Posters= 600 2 TV Ready Videos= 4,000 $ + Subtotal= 13,500 $ minimum- 27,000 $ max There are several challenges. Due to the fact that there is a over saturation of so called Rappers and Mc's that are neither. So many people think that they have what it takes. Every body is a artist now. Since the fans don't know who to trust they may have difficulty grasping the detailed positive energy being thrown at them all at once. They are used to vulgar, evil, degrading and disrespectful lyrics. They are so used to hearing horrible music they may put me in a category of safe or they may hear profanity and mistake it for what they already have heard. AJB sometimes feels like he has something meaningful to say at a time when the minds of most have been reduced to that of a kindergarten. No one likes to think anymore. Some wish to remain mindless some hopefully will wake up! RISKS AND CHALLENGES Knowing This AJB presses forward. There is no doubt the goals will be accomplished because of sheer will power, hard work, pure heart and determination. AJB is more than qualified. It took years of hard work to get to this point. Now with Kick Starter there is a endless potential of possibilities!",https://fundrazr.com/eOFB9
"1,285",Chisholm Family Farm - Micro Creamery Project,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.3k goal,25,57%,"It may not come as a surprise to hear that hay and grain costs are headed through the roof.   Hay prices are rising faster than we can keep up with!   This has inspired us to look for creative ways to keep our prices as low as possible and continue to offer the same quality grass-fed meats, dairy, and poultry as have always produced.   While we hear stories of farmers feeding candy to their cows we have found another way to navigate through the drought and resulting hay prices.  We have embarked upon a new venture and we need your support.   We are converting an old camper into a mobile micro creamery!  Our plan is to turn part of our milk production into yogurt and cheese made here on our farm.   We have taken out a loan and purchased  a 30 gallon pasteurizer and cheese vat as well as bottling equipment.  We bought an old camper . We have begun purchasing things such as an incubator cabinet, three compartment sink, and stainless steel tables, that we will need to produce yogurt and cheese.     We have begun tearing out the inside of the camper and found that the floor needs replacing.  We also need to put a drain in the floor, replace many of the walls, and re-wire and plumb the whole thing.  Supplies such as plywood, concrete board, ceramic and rubber tiles, windows, tin, and more need to be purchased. We are asking for your help.  We need to raise 7,500 to complete the project.

915,Garden Monsters Start Up Assistance,U.S. Dollar,,of $2k goal,34,46%,"Just under a year ago I lost what I thought would be a long stable job with Yahoo!. I was so blind sided by this that I wasn't even upset at the time. I knew that I was spinning my wheels in a 'career' I wanted no part of 5-10 years down the road. I took this as a clear sign that I was meant to part ways. About a month into unemployment (for the first time in my life) I woke up one day with an idea and immediately began putting it on paper. Five hours later I had half of menu written down and felt with absolute certainty that I knew what I was supposed to do with the next chapter in my life. I spent the next 7 months making preparations to open Portland's very first Premium Salad Restaurant using 100% natural and organic ingredients. With my business plan and financial analysis complete I began looking for location, however due to the youthful age of my small business no bank or credit union was willing to lend me any money. They directed me towards the Small Business Association, who then directed me back to my bank. After completing that circle I spent the next few weeks incredibly discouraged, but with the support of my friends who I call family I decided to change my attitude and began adjusting my plans. I'm a one man entrepreneur following my dream and putting literally everything I have into this. As of January 10th we're nearly done with construction however my life savings has been tapped and we've just about run out of funds for the project. Some friends asked how they could help and suggested that we set up this Paypal account, so here goes nothing. Accepting all forms of positive energy and Paypal donations - any contributions whatsoever are appreciated more than you could ever know. All $10 donations will be matched with a free drink coupon and a pair of Garden Monsters stickers (please let me know which address to mail them to!). Thank you to all of our friends, family and fans for helping us get Garden Monsters off the ground! We can't wait to start serving you up with the best salads Portland has ever seen.

Most of you already know that I’ve been baking and decorating since age 5 at home for my family and friends, and since age 12 at my parents’ restaurants, in Paterson New Jersey. Did you know that I have always dreamed of opening my own bakery by the age of 40 in 2013? Well, I’m turning 40 soon! (1/29 to be exact) I have been preparing for this dream all of my life. I've gone to culinary school, worked in the baking industry for the past 20 years and achieved the title of Executive Pastry Chef (trust me, It’s a big deal). I have launched Sweet Creations as a home-based bakery a year and a half ago, and I’ve been teaching Pastry Arts in several of the elementary schools in the area to help make ends meet. Please help me to make my dream come true. I have completed my business plan, found a location to set up shop and secured a loan to help finance a good portion of the project. I have managed to save up $35,000 of the down payment, however I am still short another $21,000. I am now down to the wire and still need to raise the down payment by March 15th. I'm turning to my family and friends to help me make this dream come true. Please be one of the 100 people to pledge $200. You would be giving the best birthday gift ever: A Dream Come True!

Another scenario is needing to save space on the shelves for your collections of multiple disc jewel cases. My name is Forrest, and using my certified Photoshop skills and experience with eBay, I want to have a way to assist these game collectors while also furthering my trade. I've been making a few custom cases for the last half of the year, some cases made for single games, some for games with multiple discs, and even cases to hold whole trilogies of games. To remedy the problem of the crackable jewel case, my designs have been made for the more durable and space saving DVD case. Example cases I've made include Ape Escape, the Spyro Trilogy, Final Fantasy VIII, and Crash Bandicoot 2. I'm able to create top notch designs in Photoshop, but getting them to eBay is a different story, and that's why I need your help. On eBay, buyers look for cases with not only a good cover, but also high quality prints on glossy DVD paper, and a DVD case included. My problem is the lack of funds for wholesale lots of DVD cases, ink, glossy paper, and even a cutting mat to make those cases perfect. I enjoy my case making, and it would be really great to put my skills to a good use. Please donate today, and help the aspiring and creative entrepreneur.

310,Help Me Open a Health Spa in Bandera!,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,5,2%,"It took me seven years and two failed attempts at going to college to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up.  I figured it out through an epiphany and red, swollen eyebrows one afternoon as I laid in my favorite esthetician's chair.  After subjecting the poor girl to a lengthy interrogation about state regulations and education requirements to become an esthetician, I did some research and I liked what I learned. I chose the Milan Institute of Cosmetology in San Antonio to study esthetics and I graduated in 2007 with honors as the salutatorian and started work immediately at Mane Street Salon & Spa in San Antonio.  I was the only esthetician there and I had the pleasure of working alongside two nurses from a local dermatologist's office who administered Botox injections and other dermal fillers.  They were great sources of information and I enjoyed participating in the post-treatment care of their clients. The spa was open Tuesday through Saturday and my schedule was filled with regular clients  with a little room for walk-ins.  I loved my regulars and I enjoyed treatments with them because I was able to improve some aspect of their lives esthetically while we talked like we’d been friends forever.  I knew names and faces of pets and kids, they would bring me recipes that they thought I’d be interested in or I’d see things while I was out that reminded me of a particular client so I’d have to pick it up for her.  I was emotionally invested in each of my clients. When my husband and I got married, we talked for a long time about our careers and our goals for our family.  We were bringing to the marriage three children and planned on having more.  Since he had been established in his career for so long and had great benefits plus retirement with his job, we decided it would be in our family’s best interest that I stay home with the kids.  So, with a heavy heart, I told Mane Street’s owner and all of my clients that I would be moving away to Bandera, and I quit my job to stay home with my children. Now, all of our children, except for our youngest, are in school and I miss working so much.  I miss that connection I had with my clients.  I miss problem-solving skin issues, helping young women feel better about themselves, and I miss learning new things about skin problems and how to treat them. I would like to open an esthetic facility in Bandera.  I would start by renting one room at the Bandera Business Center and offer microdermabrasions, chemical peels, facials, waxing, body wraps, and Tesla high-frequency treatments, and then move into a building where I would be able to grow my business to a full service spa.  I have so many more plans and I am really excited that I have the opportunity to share my skills with the women of Bandera soon! I need your help raising money so I can buy the equipment and products I need to get started. I need wax pots, a microdermabrasion machine, furniture, facial product, cost of operations, and so many more things in order to get this started! All treatments will be personalized for each client, the prices will be reasonable, and I will focus on the skin care needs of women and teenagers.  I will be working with dermatologists, nutritionists, and a professional make-up artist to offer the most and best services for the women of Bandera.  Education and research is a large focus of my practice and I will be attending esthetic, dermatalogical, and nutrition conferences as frequently as possible to bring the most up-to-date facial and body treatments to Bandera. I appreciate your donation and would like to offer to my local donors credit in the amount of your donation to go towards service costs (facials and waxing), and I would like to offer my out-of-town donors a gift to show my appreciation.",https://fundrazr.com/6TIMc

I tested several different sites that offered a special price on jewelry if you subscribe to them & pay a monthly fee every month. I had thought long and hard to bring a cool concept together & I thought about the three things I wanted to accomplish most. First of all, making some money to support myself, value each customer to give them more than they deserve, & to give back to my community. The Idea is to bring a box together of curated Jewelry items with a purpose at a flat rate price which can help the greater good. THE BOX: My idea is to offer a way for customers to select & purchase a box of 3 - 6 pieces of jewelry for one flat price where you don't have to be locked in to buy more + with easy returns if unsatisfied. Each Box Would Cost $15 & Include Free Postal Shipping Within The U.S.A. PURPOSE: Fuss + Frill would be a community where we can shop & sparkle with one another while we all stay connected. PHILANTHROPHY: When Trying To Start A Business, I Wanted To Do Something Where I Can Give Back To The Community. For Every Box Set Sold, A Percentage Will Go To A Select Cancer Organization. HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO: I am trying to working $2000 to help make my dreams come through. The money would go towards the fund of boxes/packaging materials & getting jewelry together. With Every Penny You Are Able To Donate, You Will Help Me Reach My Goal. If You Are Unable To Donate, I Encourage & Appreciate You ""Sharing"" This With All Your Friends To See If They Believe in My Dream As Well. THANK YOU'S: With Every Fundrazr Donation, I Will Personally Send Each & Everyone of You A Thank You Note Expressing My Sincere Appreciation of Your Support. Remember Dreaming is Believing & You Can Achieve Anything.... Sincerely, Timmy Prak-Fenty",https://fundrazr.com/9Ubqc

430,"Sustain the Mission--Food, Biz, Farm, Community",,,,,,"Your nourishment will help grow & sustain Incu-BaKe! Incu-BaKe helps small food businesses get started.  After nearly two years of development and operation, we’ve become much more than just a shared kitchen space. From concept to licensing, Incu-BaKe has created a space for nearly 50 entrepreneurs in the last 24 months, all who have had a dream and needed a space to launch and live it. We provide mentoring, support and the equipment to launch businesses—and businesses eventually create jobs! One of our very first clients, Schenk’s Salsa, was completely ready to launch in July, 2011. They had their processing certification, they had their labels, their recipe . . . not to mention hungry clients. What they were missing was a commercial kitchen! Now, their award winning salsa has devoted followers in mid-Michigan, and they are looking to move beyond just the Lansing area. Incu-BaKe also helped to launch Crunch Granola, a dream business for Christine. She doesn’t just create and sell delicious granola, but feeds hungry, struggling families. For every bag of granola sold, 2 meals are donated to feed a family. Since January, 2012 (and starting with the very first bag they sold), Crunch Granola has provided over 26,000 meals to families. Now, Incu-BaKe wants to take its business model to the next level. High-Capacity Equipment Need Incu-BaKe is filling a service gap; we help small businesses launch and become job creators. As larger businesses such as Whole Foods, Barnes and Noble, Kroger, and others are seeking out local food products, these startups need to be able to handle the volume of the orders that are required, in order to prove themselves in the larger marketplace. Our goal is to triple our oven space, and install a steam-jacketed kettle to increase our salsa/sauce/savory production by about 500%. With a few pieces of low-cost equipment, the yield will increase exponentially, as will utilization of local produce and other goods and services. In doing so, more small businesses will reach the “emerging” stage, where they will be able to move on into their production facilities, such as our graduate “Mitten Munch!” Recycling and Sustainability Systems Every week we have gallons of eggshells and produce waste, just begging to be composted into “black gold”! Incu-BaKe will use funding to implement recycling and sustainability practices, including an on-site recycling service and a compost tumbler. Business Education Training and Workshops Incu-BaKe provides mentoring to help small businesses get started. We've discovered that these businesses need ongoing training and support. Incu-BAKE will partner with key organizations to provide affordable best business practices training. Your contribution will allow us to take the only Incu-BaKe kitchen for small businesses to the next level. We thank you in advance for supporting Incu-BaKe as it positions itself to be a high-capacity facility for small food businesses.",https://fundrazr.com/1VsMc

100,Help Avonova Creative Grow,U.S. Dollar,,of $500 goal,1,20%,"Avonova Creative is a group of student programmers and designers aimed at indie game development. We need your help to lay a foundation towards growing into a functioning operation. A new generation of independent game developer is starting to blossom in this world. With the creation of open-source consoles (such as OUYA), the market for indie game developers is finally getting the recognition it deserves. Avonova Creative is setting out to create its own share of the independent game market. Avonova Creative, or AvCre, is a group of students devoted to developing the skills needed within the indie game market. For almost two years, we’ve been learning the skills needed for game development. We aren’t asking for money to help fund a project, though. We are asking for your help to allow us to achieve our goal of becoming a functioning group. As stated earlier, we are students…BROKE students. But even though we are broke, we are not giving up the drive to carve out our own place in the future of small independent game development. The money you raise will go towards  any expenses needed to get our group off of the ground. This isn’t investment in a corporation for ownership shares, but rather helping some kids whose dreams are starting to get held back by financial inabilities. None of the pledged money will go towards personal finances, of course. It will go towards laying the foundation needed that will help AvCre achieve in its projects (not going to lie, there has been a few failed projects). It will go towards any fees needed to acquire necessary developmental tools. We know that people are generous and we hope that you can help this group of students achieve what they have always wanted. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this and I hope that you can support us! http://avonovacreative.com/",https://fundrazr.com/bR0R6

I'm currently a stay home mum living in Perth, I have a daughter who turns 2 at the end of this month (May) and a Partner who is injured and can't work for a couple weeks. If it weren't for my family who hold a roof over our heads and keep food in the cupboards, we would probably be back in NZ. I'm currently looking for jobs and have applied for about a dozen worth but I forgot how much of a pain it was to look for a job, to make sure that you have the right experience for a job position, to calculate how much it would cost to travel and make sure it is not too far from my house of residence, to settle with the pay jobs are offering and to work in a role that you don’t even enjoy. WELL I’VE HAD ENOUGH, I’M SAYING NO TO HAVING NO FREEDOM AND I’M READY TO PURSUE MY DREAM LIFESTYLE WHILE HAVING NO REGRETS. What I'm raising money for is an online business venture and I can't go into much detail about it but you will see through Facebook what it is that I'm doing. I've already put in some hours to get this business venture going and I’m not about to stop here, I will fight for my dream, I will continue to learn new skills and tricks that will get me closer to my dream and I will stay focused to achieve my dream. I will always strive to make a better living for my family and if it means dreaming the impossible then so be it because when I make that impossible dream possible, there is no end to what else I can achieve. The big question is this, WHAT CAN YOU DO? If you can donate whatever amount you want to get me started and get me going I would be very grateful. As you can tell we are slowly running out of options at this time so please donate as big or as little and although I can’t give you any prizes or thank you gifts for donating, I can show you what your money is going towards. Follow me and I will keep you updated on my progress from when I receive my money to what my personal situation is and how you helped. I will put a diary up; it may be a weekly or monthly entry to show you how your donation is helping me. Once again I’m going all in with this entrepreneur venture and if you can help me break this cycle of “settling for less” then maybe I can return the favour in the future. If you're still not sold, have a good long look at my picture - that's who I'm doing this for and I will continue to try and better our future so that I can give them everything I have to offer. Like I said any contribution is more than worthy to me and I would greatly appreciate it, thank you for stopping by and have an awesome day/night. Nicola Taoro",https://fundrazr.com/1VCza

190,H.E.R.O.- Helping Vets Return Home / PTSD Research,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,8,2%,"We are determined to raise the needed funding to conduct a small
  clinical research trial of a PTSD treatment which has already been
  used successfully to treat the physical effects of Cancer, Parkinson's
  and Alzheimer’s patients.  Our current research reflects that this
  treatment should RESOLVE the problems of anxiety, sleeplessness and
  'night terrors' associated with PTSD ~ and, do so WITHOUT the use of
  drugs, prescriptions, or surgery.  Our research also shows that as
  this treatment begins to take effect, the human body has the ability
  to begin to HEAL ITSELF, thus beginning the process of addressing a
  large number of other PTSD symptoms, such as: Hyperarousal - Increased physical or emotional arousal Difficulty sleeping Irritability or outbursts of anger Difficulty concentrating or thinking clearly An exaggerated startle response (triggers bring you back to a
    certain combat zone event) Hypervigilence, being overly angry or aggressive (feeling as if
    you need to defend yourself from danger) Panic attacks Further, we believe that IF this treatment proves successful (via
  this clinical trial), that this same treatment can be used as a
  complementary treatment to psychological counseling sessions to
  achieve 'breakthroughs' and aid in resolving the deeper conflicts in a
  more expedited manner; with the added benefit of making treatment for
  PTSD much more affordable. Our aim is a RESOLUTION - a CURE - which allows individuals to
  re-connect with themselves, their families and loved ones, as well as,
  interact naturally and normally within their environments without the
  fear or anxiety. While PTSD affects a varied group of persons who have experienced
  trauma and survived traumatic events, our initial study’s focus in on
  U.S. GWOT Veterans.  Once the clinical trial is complete, the results
  will be published and shared so that all affected will be able to benefit. If you support this cause or want to help raise awareness of
    PTSD (and those who suffer with it) – we hope you will “LIKE” our
    page and follow our progress. We also hope you will “SHARE” our page and our posted updates

245,A couple trying for a dream due to rough times.,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.5k goal,12,16%,"Hello there, My name is Thomas, the main goal of this fundraiser is for purchasing a new computer set up due to some rough times we've had. I've been saving towards this way too long. The main uses for this computer will be a long term goal of audio/video media I hope to produce. It may be as simple as livestreaming some gaming for people, audio/video shows on games and possibly more in the future, making videos of game plays and game reviews for online and possibly console games. That's the core of it, neither me or my wife have decent laptops for barely playing s game let alone these things we want to do. Now the story of why I am trying this fundraiser. I've always worked and done my best to support myself and my wife who's a long time(17 years) paraplegic. Back in Feb. she got severely sick with multiple things and ended up hospitalized, for the first time ever she had a couple pressure sores under the skin on each hip and they were extremely bad,one had gone as far as infecting the leg bone partially. It came down that she had to be moved to another state for better care for an undetermined amount of time. I made the decision to quit my job and move up there with her. Basically 2 months and 4 surgeries later(one of which involved them removing the section of femur bone infected)we were still there. Very stressed on the situation/money/and other things. We came back home and due to the medical care I have to supply daily and her turning regiment I knew it would be a long time before I could go back to work. It's still undetermined when she can even get up out of bed let alone sitting 8 hours or such. What I hope to do is through some luck and hard work I want to get heavy on gaming online not for fun but business as well. I want to try and produce content for current and future games in hopes of generating a bit of money until I can return to a job. Even then I still plan of streaming,making videos because it's something I feel  I can benefit from,my wife can benefit from, and who knows others can as well. Any amount is appreciated, and please let us know who you are and i'll do my best to thank each and every one with a personal email/message/whisper whatever works. Thanks and have a great day!",https://fundrazr.com/fZd34

120,Fighting Climate Change and Improving the Economy,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.4k goal,3,5%,"I'm an environmental economist volunteering on a study that will help the Republic of Vietnam fight climate change AND improve the health and welfare of its people.  I've got my time covered, but I'm seeking help to cover my flight and lodging for the necessary time I'll spend working directly with the rest of the project team Ha Noi. Here's the full scoop. Thanks to my employer's (The Wilderness Society, a US-based ENGO) excellent sabbatical program, I am taking some time this summer to volunteer with the Vietnamese Ministry of the Environment, specifically its Institute of Science for Environmental Management. The project is to estimate the economic value of all of the good things that come along for the ride when one reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We are focusing on the wastewater and solid waste sectors, so these ""co-benefits"" include reduced disease (water treatment both decreases methane emissions and exposure of people to pathogens), lower fuel costs (switching from oil or diesel to captured methane), and lower costs for agricultural fertilizer. Vietnam is a fast-growing country with a population of 90 million (about on third that of the U.S.) living in an area a bit bigger than New Mexico. According to the UN, it is also one of the countries most affected by climate change, particularly sea level rise. Vietnam’s own per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are lower than in the U.S., but Vietnam’s rapidly growing and developing economy means that emissions will increase. Tackling GHG emissions earlier in the development process is wise because it means Vietnam will have more chances to develop sustainably, to strike a better balance between growth and environmental conservation, and to avoid even more difficult and expensive mitigation measures later on. (The country is already moving rapidly to protect and restore forests as part of its climate change mitigation strategy (the REDD program).) So on the one hand, climate change mitigation is very important, in and of itself, for Vietnam (as it is for the rest of us).  The trouble is that prices GHG emission reduction credits are at rock bottom, and that makes it hard to justify investments in GHG reduction – the return on investment will simply be too low if the only returns are from the sale of emission reduction credits. Fortunately, there is at least in theory, the proverbial “other hand:” the very same investments will also produce streams of benefits in the form of lower operating costs for several industries who can use the energy or by-products of methane capture technologies, higher productivity and lower health care costs for rural and municipal water system users, higher returns to investments in recreation and tourism development (to which cleaner air, water and land is a boon), and improved environmental quality that supports, directly or indirectly, industries ranging from fisheries and agriculture to professional services. What’s most important is that the human impact behind all those đồng (dollars-and-cents) is greater health and happiness for millions of people. Needless to say, I’m pretty excited to have a chance to bring my skills and expertise (in the field of environmental economics) to a project of such importance. At a practical level, my engagement is mainly from my home office in Charlottesville, Virginia tracking down value estimates that can translate to the conditions and outcomes in Vietnam, and spending a good bit of time on Skype with my new colleagues 11 time zones away.  For 12 days in August however, I will be on site in Ha Noi, integrating my work with that of the Institute's own researchers. After that, I’ll be helping to prepare the final report due in October and hoping that our results provide the information the Ministry needs to say “yes” to further climate change mitigation and environmental improvements for the people of Vietnam. As I said at the top, The Wilderness Society’s sabbatical program makes my volunteering a lot easier, since I get to draw down a pile of unused sick leave and vacation to cover my time.  But getting to Vietnam is pretty expensive, and all of my travel, lodging, etc. is out of my own pocket.  That’s where you all come in.

101,"END to the ""need"" for GMO crops",,,,,,"End the ""need"" for GMO crops. Many scientists support both sides. Some say they are very dangerous, and others say there is no harm. Truth be told, GMO foods have only been around for about 20 years. At the beginning only a trace amount of these crops could be found in our food supply. Today it is nearly impossible to buy food with no trace of GMOs. They are used in nearly every processed food and drink available across America. There hasn't been enough time for the amount we consume today to say one way or another. But there is proof diseases like diabetes, cancer, ADD, ADHD, heart disease, and many others are on the rise. Beyond connecting these facts there is no proof beyond statistics that GMOs are the cause in the rise. It could also be the chemicals they spray on the fields that these crops are designed to resist getting into the air we breath, and the water we drink. Or it could just be a genetic defect from generational degeneration. In years to come the scientific fact will fruit the cause of this disease uprise, but why wait when there's another option? My name is Ian, and I'm a 30 year old visionary, an engineer, and focused on developing a system to put our food system back into the hands of the family farmer and out of the hands of money hungry corporations. For 10 years I have been researching agriculture, and designing vertical farming systems to replace the current open field system that currently is the main source for all crops. For years I couldn't figure out a viable system for corn. I created a box, and was stuck. On July 5, 2013, I woke from a vision. I asked myself over and over again why I had been so ignorant, why I allowed myself for so many years be stuck in a box that didn't allow me to envision the system to make corn a vertical indoor farm possibility. I am now seeking help from the public to build a prototype model of the system I've designed, and file a patent on the system. By doing so it will protect the system from getting into corporate farmers, and allow me to regulate just who gets to use it. My focus is family farmers. I'm developing a business called Eco-Vert Farms, which is a business that creates vertical farms on family farmers properties, and funnels nearly half of its revenue into the hands of those families, and the other revenue into developing vertical farms on other family farmers land, and research and development to further improve designs, and design systems for other crops that won't grow in current designed systems. Creating a support system for family farmers both generational and new farmers alike. To provide a strong local food supply. With a corn system developed, this can also add a source for local bio-fuel in a sustainable matter as well! I NEED your help though! Donate as little as $1 and make a real difference. Donations are processed through PayPal, and you do not need a PayPal account, you just need a credit or debit card.

135,"""Caledonia Park"" Scottish Heritage Centre.",Canadian Dollar,,of $200k goal,4,0%,"It was three years ago that I made my decision to leave my Scottish homeland and set off to British Columbia to start a new life.   An engineer with twenty-five years’ experience in the trade, I closed my business, sold my home, packed everything up and boarded a plane with my Canadian partner, intent on achieving great things in my new adopted country. I am passionate about my home nation's rich and colourful history and heritage, and daily I watch as our culture is besmirched and ridiculed in today's fairly shallow media. So it seems obvious, to me at least, what needs doing! My dream is to set up the North American continent’s first ‘Scottish Heritage Park’... a unique visitor attraction that could become a major feature of BC's, if not the North American continent's, tourism industry. So, along with the proceeds from the sale of my property in the UK, and your help here on Fundrazr, I hope to kick-start my venture albeit on a grass-roots scale, but with great ambitions for extensive further development. My vision is of the creation of “Caledonia Park” Scottish Heritage Centre, a pleasant country park space with a visitor centre.  A place for local people and visitors to enjoy a maintained open space for picnics and countless special occasions, but with a number of very unique features… Dotted across the parkland would be a large number of authentic artefacts, buildings, monuments and other structures that one would expect to encounter if on an extensive guided-tour of Scotland.  The landscape itself would be laid to reflect the many facets of the Scottish countryside, from rolling grassland to heather moor, deciduous woodland and heath, even a small Scottish 'loch' with resident monster!  The centre piece of the park would be the Heritage Centre, complete with museum, conference suite, function rooms, restaurant, authentic Scottish pub and much, much more. The idea was to bring a taste of Scotland to North America, to allow those who might not otherwise be able to visit their ancestral home an opportunity to learn all about their history, to celebrate the rich heritage and engage in the cultural nuances that make Scotland one of the world’s best tourist destinations. The park could also be an educational facility, a place for students to learn about the heroic battles, philosophical triumphs, artistic and architectural wonders, the engineering, scientific and medical developments, as well as the tragedies and trials of Scotland’s rich and colourful past. I see the park being an integral part of the local community, providing a venue for public events and unique facilities for a variety of artisans to create and market their products… all whilst enthralling the visitors with their skills.  Certain features of the park can be leased to local small business operators.  Clubs could also be involved with some of the more unique heritage displays. Since the decision to move to BC was made, my partner and I have developed an extensive business plan for the park.  It lists countless innovative ways to involve the local community, raise awareness of wider British, as well as Scottish culture and heritage and provide a fabulous facility for public events.  I have compiled a long list of historical architecture experts, stonemasons and woodworkers, landscapers and events-organisers that can assist me in the creation and development of the park and its facilities.  I myself am a keen amateur Scottish historian and my closest friend has recently completed his history degree and offers his services toward the creation of this fantastic vision. For the past two years I have been voluntarily administrating the Scottish Cultural Centre's Facebook page, promoting Scottish culture and history for the enlightenment of those who use Facebook and well as raising the profile of the centre in Vancouver.  I have raised the profile of the page from a mere 40 viewers to over 1500, and my informative posts have reached upwards of 38,000 people. I hope you agree with me, that “Caledonia Park & Scottish Heritage Centre” would be a unique, world-class tourist attraction, a jewel in British Columbia’s tourism crown.  And who knows… perhaps if it’s a success, we could open new parks elsewhere on the American continent. The funds I am asking for today will help me persuade investors and landowners that I am serious about my plans and hope they will join us in seeing this dream come to fruition.

"1,101",Help My Compassionate Goat Farm Succeed!,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,32,7%,"My compassionate goat farm needs a small barn for my goats, additional soap-making equipment, & a small workshop. I am Che Sweetland, owner of a micro-farm in rural Maine. I feel that traditional dairy goat farming techniques are often not in the best interest of the goats. These farming techniques are not acceptable and need to be changed. Compassionate Farming is my passion! A little over a year ago, I began selling all-natural, handmade goat milk soap that I create with compassionately-farmed milk from my pet goats. I am on a mission to show the world that we can farm compassionately and build a farm that is able to sustain itself financially. I make each of these products with milk that I hand-milk from my goats. A BARN: THE PROBLEM - I need a few more breeding goats in order to increase milk production. I have incredible friends who are willing to provide the goats I need. My goats currently have the luxury of a large, varied pasture. Unfortunately, their shelter has been a tiny shed and oversized dog houses. These tiny buildings are adequate for keeping them warm and dry. However, they are not ideal. THE SOLUTION - In order to expand my herd, I need a small barn. This will allow the goats to have a larger, safer sheltered area where they can live comfortably during harsh weather. THE PROBLEM - I currently hand-milk the goats under a makeshift lean-to. This keeps most of the rain off the goats and me. However, mosquitoes, and other biting insects are nearly unbearable at times. Both the goats and I are often bitten by insects during milking. THE SOLUTION: With the new barn, I will be able to have an enclosed space in which to enjoy milking sessions with my goats. Hand-milking time is a wonderful time to bond with and pamper the goats. It will be luxurious to be able to take our time with milking, grooming, and cuddling once we are no longer “under attack” by these biting insects. EQUIPMENT: THE PROBLEM - I currently have only one set of soap-making equipment. I have recently turned down some opportunities because I would be unable to meet the need for more soap in a shorter period of time. This is heartbreaking to me. THE SOLUTION - In order to increase my production, I need more equipment. I will be better able to meet the increasing current and future demand for my products. Keeping the soap and lotion business thriving will allow me to continue providing my goats with their exceptional, compassionate lifestyle. A WORKSHOP: THE PROBLEM - Right now, I make my soap and lotion in my kitchen. I cure my soaps and store supplies in my home office, where I work days at my desk. I store finished products near my laundry room. I store my packaging and shipping supplies in a corner of my living room. This set-up is functional but far from ideal. THE SOLUTION - If I had a small workshop, all of these tasks and materials could be more efficiently managed in one space. I would be able to streamline processes and save time and energy. YOU CAN HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN! GOAL #1 - $5,000 - This goal meets my most immediate need. The care of my animals is always my highest priority. Therefore, the first goal is to have a small barn for my adorable goat herd that is safe and secure. GOAL #2 - $2,000 for a total of $7,000 - My second goal will increase my equipment so that I can make three times as much soap as I can currently make. GOAL #3 - $8,000 for a total of $15,000 - My third goal will allow me to create a workshop space. This space will make it possible for me to separate my products from my home, will streamline my processes and production, and will consolidate my supplies, ingredients, equipment, products, and packaging into one efficient space. The sky is the limit!! If we can raise amounts higher than these goals,  I may be able to add a small retail space to my workshop so that customers can come here to meet the goats and shop for the products they want. This space may also be used as instructional space for classes on soap-making, compassionate farming, goat care, knitting, and other topics. Opening my farm to the community would allow me to give back to some of the people who have been so incredibly helpful to me in this amazing journey. Please help me make this dream a reality! Help me spread the word about compassionate farming! Help me prove to traditional farmers that compassionate farming is a successful, sustainable method of farming, keeping the animals’ welfare as the highest priority.  The more you donate and share this project with others, the greater this farm can become! I greatly appreciate every single donation! If the amount that you would like to donate is not shown, you may type it in. Participating in perks is optional. If you would like to donate more than $1,000 and have a particular perk that you'd like, feel free to contact me about it and we can discuss whether or not I can provide that perk to you.

"1,717",Become A Partner In Our Venture,U.S. Dollar,,of $250k goal,1,1%,"So as we have all been taught or heard many times before, “Necessity is the mother of invention.”  And, here is a great example of this! Larry and I want to offer you, anyone investing a thousand dollars or more, a part of our new venture, BODACIOUS??????, which has the potential to make millions of dollars, especially once we franchise across the whole United States while using many of the funds we earn to continue to expose a truth we’ve been working on for over sixteen years in one form or another, which will help all Americans as well as the whole of society the world over. We speculate, in the beginning of this venture, to earn over three thousand dollars a day with one red truck. Within a good six weeks after this we’ll be managing at least three more red trucks, in the area, before expanding into a number of bordering states in advance to offering franchises. Many of you have the opportunity to earn money off your investment in our talent, creativity, vision, hard work and exposé, after the first six months of our launch of BODACIOUS?????? Some of you may want to hang in for the long haul; it’s all about how much you want to invest in the beginning and our negotiating.  We’ll have the opportunity to realize our creative business endeavor; rebuild our lives while finding a daily successful purpose, and continuing to expose behind the scenes financial crimes and corruption, that the public has no clue to, by your investment(s) and our working and marketing the business. This business venture is truly an opportunity for Americans as well as the whole of the public to work together to create a better world…through mobile gourmet food in a red truck. But this is all I can share without your signature on our NDA. debbiebreuner@yahoo.com Larry and I have battled the corrupt financial, legal and government system for sixteen years in total after I had 80M$s embezzled out of my trust account and when I reported this horrendous crime to the proper authorities, instead of an investigation, into the financial institutions, trustees and attorneys involved, I experienced more federal crimes committed against my trust, me and at this point attacking Larry too because we were in a growing, flourishing business together and the situation like a ""Mafia Hit"" destroyed everything in it's wake, including the business. We lost not only our business through unaddressed federal crimes, but also five of our precious family of dogs; three multimillion dollar properties; two of which were homes; one in escrow; our vehicles, furniture, jewelry, sliver, china, antiques and family heirlooms. Many of these belongings we sold for pennies on the dollar so we could eat as we were, because of our whistle blowing, being prevented from retaining employment or government assistance and so living in a tent for three years. Fact is in this country, if your credit is destroyed by federal crimes, and you are over forty years old, there is relatively no possible way for you to retain employment ever again, especially if you have always been self-employed. Your degrees mean nothing! We believe this is what our corrupt financial institutions and USA Government counts on! What we have found is that the legal system in this country is not upholding the federal laws, already in place, and the government authorities that regulate the financial institutions are not doing so. Hence after years of hope, faith and belief in our legal system we have finally decided to change course, realizing our USA legal system isn't working and no matter what we do to try and force it to it won't. It's corrupt. Larry and my goals have always been to expose to the public what is actually going on in the financial institutions, behind the scenes, which is far worse than the media will reveal. I've written a memoir in five volumes; together Larry and I have mentored with the proper English professor and learned how to write screenplays and adapted the five-part memoir to four feature film scripts. In order to finance these ventures, the books and films of Dominick Dunne certain approval, we must do something to raise funds besides ask for donations. So again, as we have all been taught or heard many times before, “Necessity is the mother of invention.” We’re going into business offering you a piece of this business for investments over $1,000 not that a $1,000 or less wouldn’t be appreciated, it’s just not enough to earn you a piece of the action, and pay for the paperwork, stamps, checks etc. involved, without the rest of us losing money, other than forwarding some one time gifts of gratitude your way; honoring you with recognition and paying you back exactly the amount you invested. You've earned this! Our goal is to generate $250,000.00; our prospectus will explain the business; where these funds will be going; how they will be used; when you, as an investor, can expect a return of at least double your investment.

  Hotel in Managua presenting my ""dream"" to local ""Angel
  Investors"". I needed an investor who would believe in me and
  provide me with the capital I needed to grow my business. I put my
  heart and soul into the presentation but wasn't able to convince the
  ""Angles"" that they should invest in a social business that
  was going to use profits from sales of gourmet coffee to support
  entrepreneurship in Nicaragua and make a difference in the lives of
  thousands of people. I was emotionally devastated and financially I
  had reached the end. I had put all my money into building this
  business and without the help of outside investment I had to close
  down operations and entered the ""gutter"". It has been one of
  the hardest and most humbling years of my life but also one of the
  most blessed. I didn't think I was going to make at times but with
  God's help I kept going and the dream stayed alive. In October I
  entered a business pitch competition that I saw online and I was
  selected to go to New York and participate as a semi-finalist. I need
  your help to make it to New York and represent not only my country but
  the dreams of all those who are fighting to make it in this world. The video above was my 2 minute elevator pitch that helped me
  get to the semi-finals for La Idea Business Pitch Competition. The “La Idea” business pitch competition is an initiative of
  former U.S. Secretary of the State Hilary Clinton. The U.S. State

  a prize package that includes up to $95,000 in grant awards,
  customized business support services, high-profile visibility on on an

  Nicaraguans and Latinos to become social entrepreneurs and make a
  difference in our country and the world. I appreciate any help you can
  provide and promise I will do everything I can to win this competition

  facilitator of a social, discussion and support group called VanIsle

  from every single woman that is part of the Red Light Girl family, and
  how their positive energy is effective on to both women and men. The Matter at Hand: No matter how many times I’ve been told to raise my prices, I refuse
  to. I could not imagine raising my prices and making it unaffordable
  or something a girl has to save for. I have been shown too many times
  how positive this experience is and therefore I will always strive to
  keep my prices reasonable. I’ve always had the want to promote the Red Light Girls to the degree
  they deserve, however my own finances and refusal to raise my prices
  keeps me from living out that dream. With helpful donations I am
  hoping in time to raise enough money to get the Red Light Girls more
  promoted. They deserve it! RLG clothing, hats, beanies, stickers,
  calendars, table side books are all items I would love to see more of!

  deals and getting presents for friends and loved ones, there is just
  one present I could ask for and it's far too costly for any one person
  to get by themselves. I've been told that there is no shame in asking for help, and with
  finances and employment status being what they are I can't be too
  proud to ask. So, I am humbly accepting donations to keep developing
  games independently while looking for employment, as I can still
  remain productive doing what I know with the copious amounts of free
  time I have.  This is an opportunity to help provide for my family by
  giving me the tools that make it possible to publish games by myself -
  without the need for additional programmers, without the long amounts
  of time that I just don't have to get a product out to market. 
  Everyone wants steady employment, and this isn't going to stop me from
  looking - it just provides the opportunity to earn enough to keep a
  roof over our heads while I do it. The money raised will be used to purchase a license for Game
    Maker: Studio - which is a platform-agnostic development tool
  that will allow me to publish games on a variety of platforms
  including Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Tizen, Windows 8 Phone,
  HTML5, and Steam. The suite normally costs $799.99, but for the
  weekend of Black Friday is $499.99 through December 3rd, and I hope to
  raise enough funds to purchase it at the reduced price before it goes
  off sale (hence the $500 fund-raising goal). Anyone who knows me is aware that I don't like to leave debts unpaid.
  Once I am able to launch a full product to the marketplace (or if I
  find employment - which ever comes first) I will be making a serious
  effort to ensure everyone who invested in my venture is paid back in
  full... along with a free copy of the game(s) I release. That's a promise.",https://fundrazr.com/aeUE2

  international research program that has facilities in various remote
  parts of the world such as Indonesia, Romania, and even Cuba. They
  support undergraduate and graduate students by offering them unique
  research opportunities and courses to teach them skills necessary for
  field research. I would like to travel to Honduras for six weeks and work at their
  forest and marine sites. At the forest site for my first week I will
  learn jungle survival techniques and be trained in the data collection
  methods that are primarily used throughout the trip. The next two
  weeks are what I am really looking forward to. I will be taking a
  biodiversity monitoring course and helping with an ongoing tarantula
  study along with trapping other invertebrates to determine their
  diversity in the forest. The next three weeks will be spent at the
  marine facility. The fourth week I will take an open water diving
  course learning to explore the marine environment in a safe manner and
  gaining diving certification. The next course for the fifth week will
  be a reef ecology course where I will learn how to identify various
  marine organisms and learn the basic techniques required for
  collecting data. For my final week I will use these skills to collect
  data for a reef and benthic communities course. Unfortunately, this program is not cost free and while some things
  are provided there will be additional expenses to consider. So I would
  like to ask if you can, to donate any amount to help me reach my goal. Here is the link to Op Wall's site: http://opwall.com And the program I want to participate in: http://opwall.com/undergrad-research-assistants/locations/honduras/",https://fundrazr.com/3cIC3

  how much damage natural disasters can cause in countries, unprepared,

  without the right measures in place, then as sad as this was, this
  will keep on happening again and again. It is unacceptable to simply give money, if it doesn't make a
  significant change, or else we just end up repeating the same mistakes. We believe that the way to instil change is to educate and to teach
  with practical examples. To do this we have built a business case
  around developing a commercial farm with all facilities built to FEMA
  standard ( www.fema.gov ). We are
  hoping to achieve an educational farm that showcases, not only a
  sustainable energy efficient growing techniques, but also a
  methodology for rural design that mitigates most natural disasters. We
  don’t believe we could ever protect against all disasters, but with
  the right building practices, and detailed natural disaster adaption
  plans we can at least be prepared. This is where we need your help. There is a myriad of laws,

  government entity that is responsible for the development and
  execution of government policies on farming, agriculture, forestry and
  food. The USDA vision statement states: ""to expand economic
  opportunity through innovation, helping rural America to thrive; to
  promote agriculture production sustainability that better nourishes
  Americans while also helping feed others throughout the world; and the
  preserve and conserve our nation's natural resources through restored
  forests, improved watersheds, and healthy private working lands."" The Last Plantation The Last American Plantation will be a powerful non-fiction narrative
  piece investigating and exposing the history of discriminating
  practices of the USDA and the impact it has had on minority farmers
  and the USDA employees and their families that has suffered because of
  it over the years.  The following facts and figures are topics that we
  will be discussing with experts, national journalists who has
  previously covered the topics and the people that have personally
  endured the accounts of discrimination either as a farmer and/or as an
  employee of the USDA. The Struggles of Minority Farmers African-American Farmers Protesting in front Atlanta's CNN Center According to historian Pete Daniel, the greatest
      reduction of Black farmers came in the decades of the civil rights
      movement. Between 1940 and 1974, the number of Black farmers fell
      from 681,790 to just 45,594—a drop of 93 percent. In the article, “ The Last Plantation’: Black Farmers Vs. USDA ,”
    published on December 11, 1996 in the Washington Post by Michael A.
    Fletcher, he reported that, “financing is the lifeblood of farming,
    whose practitioners generally take out large loans, based on the
    next crop, to cover their considerable operating expenses. Farmers
    who cannot obtain financing face bankruptcy, and the USDA is the
    lender of last resort for those shut out of the private credit market.” The Washington Post article goes on to state that, “between 1982
    and 1992, the number of Black farmers in the United States dropped
    by 43 percent, from 33,250 to 18,816.” During the Bush administration the USDA was accused of improperly
    mishandling over 13,000 cases on the grounds of discrimination. When
    the Obama administration took office a pledge was made to change how
    the general public perceives the USDA, and how they handle their
    programs for “ALL” farmers. President Obama tapped former Idaho
    governor, Tom Vilsack, to lead that initiative as the new Secretary
    of Agriculture to redevelop a new image and lead the new initiative
    of change. Vilsack then tapped, Dr. Joe Leonard, as the
    Assistant of Secretary of Civil Rights in the USDA’s office of the
    Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights. Leonard’s job is to investigate
    matters of discrimination that has been reported to the USDA and
    determine if further actions is warranted or not. Leonard reported
    that 3,000 of the 13,000 had warranted further investigation. The Struggles of Minority USDA Employees An image
  taken from a bathroom of the USDA Astonishing tales of employees writing racist remarks on the
    bathroom walls. Long-time managers referring to employees as explicit terms. The Final Call recently published an article, Black
    Farmers: 'Meet ME Halfway"" with the following quotes: “USDA actively worked against the economic interests of Black
    farmers. The USDA’s loan agencies, such as the Farmer’s Home
    Administration (FHA), denied Black farmers ownership and
    operating loans, disaster relief and other aid.” While Black people were fighting for their “civil rights,” the
    U.S. government was taking away their land and eliminating a whole industry. Black farmers have been suffering at the hands of a deliberate
    plan by the U.S. government to force them out of farming and to feed
    Black people denatured and genetically modified foods to slow down
    the increase of the Black population. Many Black farmers have had discrimination complaints against the
    USDA going back over 30 years, yet all the government can talk about
    is $50,000, which to most Black farmers is an insult. We have had 14 years to observe the behavior of the USDA after the
    Pigford lawsuit, initiated in 1997, and the out-of-court settlement
    in 1999.  The very farmers who went to court to save their land have
    been and are being foreclosed on, while the public believes that the
    farmers have gotten paid. Not one employee of the USDA that
    discriminated against Black farmers has been fired",https://fundrazr.com/0dmSa
